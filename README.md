# Debunking the List of Alleged atrocities committed by the US authorities
Correcting the record on US interventions—covert or overt—human rights issues, and more. This project relies on the established documentary record over allegations and sensational headlines. We must not embrace anti-intellectualism for it leads to a world of Idiocracy.
Leave your fallacies at the door. This is also not to defend every single action the US has taken, or suggest the US is perfect. Rather, to critique, one must not rely on misinformation or arguments that cannot hold their own when given even basic scrutiny. Individuals, such as service members, have done crimes—however this is few and far between—rare. Not as a matter of policy, doctrine, SOP, strategy, etc. The US investigates and holds those responsible when evidence warrants, as evidenced below, in this list.

_Definition: An extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury._

_[Legal Definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825130159/https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.49_Framework%20of%20Analysis%20for%20Atrocity%20Crimes_EN.pdf): The  term  “atrocity  crimes”  refers  to  three  legally  defined  international  crimes:    genocide, crimes against  humanity  and  war  crimes._ 

> "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." - President Barrack Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016

- On July 12, 2021, the Biden Administration issued its [report](https://www.state.gov/2021-report-to-congress-pursuant-to-section-5-of-the-elie-wiesel-genocide-and-atrocities-prevention-act-of-2018) to Congress Pursuant to Section 5 of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-441). "The Biden Administration is committed to promoting democratic values that underpin a stable international system critical to freedom, prosperity, and peace.  This Administration will defend and protect human rights around the world, and recognizes the prevention of atrocities is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility. This report highlights countries of concern and whole-of-government efforts undertaken by the Atrocity Early Warning Task Force to prevent and respond to atrocities."

Notes:
- Right-click on a hyperlink to open. Clicking directly will cause the current tab to load the link.
- A clear documentary record advances a public reckoning that enables professional values and judgment to check disinformation and to counter authoritarian, anarchist, and populist movement's contempt for facts.
- Try to convey a sense of understanding of complex matters and history. 
Putting aside misinformed, inital moral outrage in order to learn the facts, nuance and details.
- This is a living document, it will be updated as new facts are uncovered and information pours in. 
- Due to the passage of time, some things in the list are hard to investigate.
- The list isn't in any specific order. _Generally_ it's in a most to least recent.
- Under international law, incidental (collateral) deaths or injuries of civilians, even in large number, does not indicate nor imply violation of the laws of war.
- When examining primary source records, one must note that they're not all equal. Raw intel cables from Station or an embassy, for example, should not be valued in the same light as finalised intelligence products. For Congressional investigations, keep in mind any disagreement between majority & minority, same for Agency/Department Inspectors General—management comments, Accountability Review Boards, should also be examined if they disagree. Not all Governments are monolithic; not all documents are treated the same.
- [Per the ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/UICCEng.pdf), "The International Criminal Court is _not a substitute_ for national courts. According to the Rome Statute, it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. The International Criminal Court _can only intervene where a State is unable or unwilling genuinely to carry out the investigation and prosecute the perpetrators"_

## Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries.
This is misleading and in factual error.
  - Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present.
  - Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdictionof the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities.  An installation may consist of one or more sites.  

  The DoD has presence on only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sits as of [2018.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf) This is at the full [consent of host countries.](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)

### Middle East

- On June 27, 2021, President Biden, authorised US Military [defensive precision airstrikes](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2672875/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/) against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region. The targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. Specifically, the U.S. strikes targeted operational and weapons storage facilities. These strikes were legal under US domestic and international law. 0 civilians were killed.

- On June 3, 2021, the US Department of Defense released its [annual](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/02/2002732834/-1/-1/0/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2020.PDF) civilian casualty report pursuant to Section 1057 of the 2018 NDAA, as amended.
 The report covers Calander Year 2020 for Global Military operations. It assesses that in 2020, US Military operations resulted in 23 civilians killed and 10 injured. The report also updated the Department's previous casualty numbers from prior years. The DoD assessment is based off of all NGO, media, and foreign Government submissions, self-reporting, etc. Its methodology is superior to that of NGOs, as it relies on classified and sensitive methods to determine casualties, including footage before, during, and after each incident. The Department is also transparent in updating prior reporting to increase the numbers, should new credible information be discovered. The new report details the near completion of two independent studies required by Congress. 

- On May 1st, 2021, the Biden Administration declassified an [11-page document](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf) created under the Trump admin, that superseded Obama's policy framework dubbed "the [2013 PPG](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download)" that governs Counterterrorism (CT) operations Outside Areas of Active Hostilities. Like the Obama guidance, it keeps intact layered oversight and bureaucracy. Key takeways from the 2017 Principles, Standards, and Procedures for US Direct Action Against Terrorist Targets, or, "PSP" for short, include:
  - >The law of armed conflict imposes important constraints on the ways in which the United States uses force abroad.
  - >Direct action will be discriminating and precise in order to avoid noncombatant casualties. The United States goes to extraordinary lengths to reduce the likelihood of noncombatant casualties in CT operations, exercising restraint as a matter of policy that often exceeds what is required by LOAC.
  - >Direct Action should be undertaken wherever practicable and constistent with US interests and applicable domestic and international law.
  - >The United States will continue to take extraordinary measures to ensure with near certainty that noncombatants will not be injured or killed in the course of operations, using all reasonably avillable information and means of verification.
    
   Among many more restrictions and layered oversight for target approval, and general preference for capture rather than kill missions.

- On February 25th, 2021, in his first month in Office, [President Biden approved](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/27/a-letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-and-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate-consistent-with-the-war-powers-resolution/) airstrikes on lawful infrastructure targets in eastern Syria used by Iran-supported non-state militia groups. These groups were involved in recent attacks against civilians, US and coalition personnel. 0 civilians killed or wounded.

- On January 2nd, 2020, President Donald Trump [authorised a lawful](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6776446/Section-1264-NDAA-Notice.pdf) air strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of the IRGC-Qods Force, a [designated terrorist organisation.](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos.html) "As a matter of International Law, the strike targeting Soleimani in Iraq was taken in United States national self-defense, as recongnized in Article 51 of the United Nations Chater, in response to a series of escalating armed attacks that Iran and Iran-supported militias had already conducted against the United States." For an expert semi-deepdive, I recommend this [read](https://www.lawfareblog.com/was-soleimani-killing-assassination) by two world-leading experts. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region...He had orchestrated attacks...culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and [Iraqi personnel.](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)" Soleimani is a [well-documented](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-bloody-legacy-of-qasem-soleimani-11578093506) mass-murderer. His forces are known to rape innocent women on mass and commited many crimes against humanity and war crimes.

- On October 9, 2019, United Nations Mission Afghanistan released a report claiming US forces illegally struck drug facilities, resulting in civilian casualties. This report was [discredited](https://twitter.com/USFOR_A/status/1181831714714337280/photo/1) for citing Jihadi propaganda websites, its deeply flawed legal examination, etc. From the response:
  
  > "United States Forces — Afghanistan (USFOR—A) disputes the findings, legal analysis, and methodology of the UNAMA report released. USFOR—A is concerned by the way UNAMA reached its conclusions and disagrees with their mischaracterization of the Taliban in the methamphetamine production facilities; their reliance on sources with conflicted motives or limited knowledge (including the Taliban propaganda website "Voice of Jihad"); and their narrow definition of legally targetable combatants.

  > By the time USFOR—A decided to conduct precision strikes, intelligence and operations professionals knew what the Taliban narcotics production facilities looked like, exactly where they were and who was allowed entry. USFOR—A and partner organizations also knew the pattern–of–life for their operations and locales. Under US legal definitions and rules and policiies governing the conduct of war, and after exhaustive and comprehensive review of the facilities and those running them, USFOR—A and partner entities determined personnel in the labs were members of the Taliban and lawful military targets.

  > USFOR—A deliberately chose the targets and the timing for the strikes to avoid non-combatant casualties, striking during the daylight hours to maximize the ability to obtain and share site pictures which ensured we could verify the absence of civilians. On the day of operations, USFOR—A observation of the targeted sites used multiple surveillance platforms, including aircraft with full-motion video gathering capabilities. USFOR—A pre-strike processes included scores of hours of scrutiny of targeted sites to ensure we could verify non-combatants were not present. USFOR—A had degrees of certainty required at the time of the precision strikes to assess forces were only striking legal targets and avoiding non-combatant casualties and collateral damage. USFOR—A even declined to strike nearly a dozen production facilities due to even a slight possibility for civilian casualties.

  > The investigations leading to the identification and characterization of these methamphetamine production facilities, their ownership and oversight by the Taliban, the internal rules allowing entry only to Taliban combatants, as well as the flow of funds from these locations to Taliban operations, were combined operations with Afghan security partners. These operations against these Taliban revenue sources were planned and developed over the course of a year, drawing upon the expertise and resources of a wide array of interagency and inter-governmental organizations and relying upon extensive intelligence collection."
 

- In September 2019, a US drone strike targeted Da'esh terrorists in Nangarha province, according to Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. [Media alleged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-drones/u-s-drone-strike-kills-30-pine-nut-farm-workers-in-afghanistan-idUSKBN1W40NW) that 30 civilian farm workers were killed in the strike. However, according to the Department of Defense annual report on civilian casualties from US global opeations covering CY19, only [8 civilians were incidentally killed](https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/06/2002295555/-1/-1/1/SEC-1057-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-MAY-1-2020.PDF), not 30. Strike was in accordance with international law.

- US Navy SEAL, Eddie Gallagher was alleged to have killed/injured innocent civilians. This [turned out](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/06/21/legal-bombshell-explodes-on-seal-war-crimes-trial/) to be a lie from his junior SEALs. Subsequently, Gallagher was [acquited](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20476626-complete_gallagher_files_ocr) of all charges, but found guilty of one crime he never challenged: Posing for a photo with a body—something his SEAL colleagues also did, however, due to their immunities, they weren't charged. A complete breakdown of the back history, pre-trial can be found [here.](https://youtu.be/qFe-n4Eu6Mw)

- [On April 13, 2018](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/file/1067551/download), in coordination with the United Kingdom and France, the  United  States  attacked  three  facilities  associated  with  Syria’s  use  of  chemical weapons: the Barzeh Research and Development Center, the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons storage facility, and the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons bunker facility. There have been [many](https://dod.defense.gov/portals/1/features/2018/0418_syria/img/timeline.pdf) instances of the Syrian regime using these illegal weapons on innocent civilians, which is, of course, a war crime. [No civilians](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/1493658/briefing-by-secretarymattis-on-us-strikes-in-syria/) were killed or injured as a result of the US/UK/France attacks—as great care was taken to avoid them. Russia has [enabled]( https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/01/5_Lawless_StateofComplicity-1.pdf) the war crimes committed by the Syrian regime, and has also [commited](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html) many themselves. Because Russia is allied with such a thuggish rogue state, and has committed hanious acts themselves, they must [deny](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2014/08/20/attempts-to-blame-the-syrian-opposition-for-the-august-21st-sarin-attacks-continue-one-year-on/), [lie](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/11/13/russia-accidentally-provide-best-evidence-syrian-governments-involvement-sarin-attacks/) and spin truth. Just as they did for their deliberate attack on civilian airline, [MH17](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) more than [once](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334396-2016-2017-ISC-AR.html) Russia has acted as a disinfo mill: Creating lies and spreading them far and wide. Through their proxy—wikileaks—Russia has spread fake news concerning a "whistleblower" in the OPCW via the leak of emails. That headline is enough to [convince](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md) some to believe Syria is innocent, simply because they don't want to spend the time to fact-check. Suffice to say, the disinformation has been covered, and debunked by the [OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2020/02/opcw-independent-investigation-possible-breaches-confidentiality-report), [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/15/the-opcw-douma-leaks-part-1-we-need-to-talk-about-alex/), and many others—including a sufficient skill at [reading comprehension.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/11/25/emails-and-reading-comprehension-opcw-douma-coverage-misses-crucial-facts/) To quote from the OPCW, "Inspector A, he was not a member of the FFM. As described by the investigators, Inspector A played a minor supporting role in the investigation of the Douma incident, and he did not have access to all of the information gathered by the FFM team, including witness interviews, laboratory results, and analyses by independent experts. Although Inspector A’s assessment purports to be an official OPCW FFM report on the Douma incident, it is instead a personal document created with incomplete information and without authorisation." 

- Starting in [June 2017](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/12/u-s-led-forces-accused-using-white-phosphorus-syria-iraq/), photos and videos from Raqqa, Syria claiming to have shown alleged US-backed groups "illegally" using white phosphorus. While it's hard to say who was deplying it—mere use of WP is not a war crime. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon told the Washington Post that the U.S. military only uses white phosphorus in “accordance with the law of armed conflict” – for example “for screening, obscuring and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures.” 
Other Coalition forces have used WP in this manner before, in other countries: Talking to NPR, New Zealand Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan said, "We have utilized white phosphorus to screen areas within west Mosul to get civilians out safely."
For an expert breakdown of the legality of WP, this [scholarly paper](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/08-2006.pdf) provides a fantastic breakdown, as does this [entry](https://www.lawfareblog.com/jus-bello-white-phosphorus-getting-law-correct) by another expert.

- From Janurary 2015 to December 2017, US air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq & Syria, monthly, often resulted in 0 civilian casualties. Most peaks never breached 20 CIVCAS. All of these strikes were conducted in full compliance of domestic and international law, and other applicable governing authorities—according to an [independent study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048479-2018-Civilian-Casualty-Military-Study.html). The peak from March 17 2017 came from a single airstrike that [accidently killed](https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/cases/17-0341/1._ar_15_6_investigation__part_1___a__clear.pdf) just-under 112 civilians. Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional explosives that resulted in a secondary explosives.

- On April 6, 2017, following the illegal [Khan Sheykkun chemical attack](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2017_904.pdf) [by the Syrian regime](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_evaluation_nationale_-_anglais_-_final_cle0dbf47-1.pdf), the United States carried out [lawful strikes](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Assessing_US_Justifications_for_Using-Force_2.pdf) against Al Shayrat airfield, used by the regime to conduct its illegal chemical & conventional weapons attacks against civilians. 

- A [study](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-us-military-receive-benefit-doubt-when-investigating-itself-alleged-war-crimes) by two world-leading experts concerning Iraq and Afghanistan US operations concludes, "We analyzed two sets of data dealing with these wars: the first, from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), details all founded investigations alleging serious law of armed conflict violations in Iraq and Afghanistan by Sailors, SEALs, and Marines; the second, from the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA), details all cases of alleged serious law of armed conflict violations by soldiers referred to court-martial. The NCIS data indicates that ninety-two allegations of serious law of armed conflict violations were substantiated, thirty-seven of which led to courts-martial (a number of others received non-judicial punishment), and twenty-eight of which resulted in conviction. The ACCA data shows 100 referred cases, of which seventy-eight resulted in conviction on at least one offense. Many of these cases resulted in substantial sentences, including life imprisonment."

- On March 17 2017, a US airstrike [accidently killed](https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/cases/17-0341/1._ar_15_6_investigation__part_1___a__clear.pdf) 112 civilians in Mosul. Again, Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also, unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional munitions that resulted in a secondary explosives effect. Again, targeteering, and other CIVCAS mitigation efforts were all present to avoid civilians and collateral damage to the surrounding buildings. Forensic analysis confirms it was the secondary explosives that ISIS owned, that caused the civilian deaths.

- A 2017 [report](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/inspections/SIGAR%2017-47-IP.pdf), requested by Congress, examined between FY 2011–16, finds that the US investigated all allegations of human rights abuses committed by Afghan forces, including child abuse reports made externally and internally, as best they could and cut off aid to those units implicated. Convictions were landed on those who committed the crimes. The report does find some issues, and the agencies involved have their comments at the end. There wasn't a consolidated process, and as US forces drew down—they lacked the insights they once had into abuse allegations. 
  >"SIGAR found no evidence that U.S. forces were told to ignore human rights abuses or child sexual assault."

  >"Following the establishment of the State and Defense Leahy Vetting Procedures for the Afghan National Security Forces in July 2014, and a biweekly joint DOD and State Afghanistan Gross Violation of Human Rights Forum (Leahy Forum), the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD-P) began to track gross violation of human rights incidents—including child sexual assault—that were reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum. According to data provided by OUSD-P, as of August 12, 2016, the office was tracking 75 reported gross violation of human rights incidents. Of these reported incidents, 7 involved child sexual assault, 46 involved other gross violations of human rights, and 22 were classified at a level above Secret because of the sensitivity of the information or the sources and methods used to obtain the information. These incidents ranged in date from 2010 through 2016, and included gross violations of human rights allegedly committed by Afghan security forces within the MOD and MOI. The incidents reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum came from a variety of sources including intelligence reports, news articles, U.S. forces, and the Afghan government."
 
  >"Of the 75 reported incidents in the OUSD-P tracker, 7 involved allegations of child sexual assault—1 that the Leahy Forum found to be credible, 5 that remain under review, and 1 that was found not credible. Fiveof the seven involved MOI units, and two involved MOD units. The one credible incident was reported by the Afghan government. In this instance, the government reported that two ANA Special Operations Command (ANASOC) noncommissioned officers (NCOs) attempted to sexually assault a girl   to coerce information from hermother. Following a trial, both NCOs were indicted and convicted for attempted sexual assault of a minor in violation of the penal code and sentenced to 6 years of confinement. Based on the information the Afghan government provided, DOD determined that it had credible information of a gross violation of human rights and began the process to remediate the unit." 

   Also details improvements made on the Afghan side including legislative, as well as other high-level efforts by the US Government working with the Afghans.
   It found no evidence, as NGOs/media alleged, that US forces were told to ignore child sex abuse/other human rights abuses.
   
- On 28 Janurary 2017, President Trump authorised a Special Operations raid in al-Bayda, Yemen. The raid was successful, though tragic, in its collection highly important information. Media and NGOs claimed that during the raid, a firefight killed as many as 30 or more civilians. This however, was a hoax. According to declassified documents obtained by the ACLU, show that high resolution footage (covering many Points of View), and sensitive intelligence, confirm between [4-12](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf) civilian casualties. [Women also participated](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400/Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.pdf) in the fight. Classified documents also obtained by the ACLU show the mission was authorised because it satisified the [NCV 0](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/17-L-0705JS022.pdf) policy. That is, if there was even the possibility that just one CIVCAS was possible, the mission could not be approved.

- From 2015 to 2020, the US had been [aiding](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390794-Acting-GC-Letter-to-Majority-Leader-Re-Sanders.html) the Saudi-led coalition in mid-air refueling (outside Yemen airspace), International Humanitarian Law compliance, and limited intelligence sharing to help further mitigate impact to civilians. US & British Governments have worked well to train, advice and develop Saudi Arabia's international law compliance, according to a UK High Court [ruling](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf)
The [Kingdom](https://www.ksrelief.org/Pages/Partners/), [US](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-6-2020-united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-aid-people-yemen), [UK](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/countries/YE), and many other countries pour in humanitarian aid as they work with the Yemen Government to fight off Iran-backed terrorist orgs.

- In 2011, President Obama authorised the [lawful, Constitutional](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/pages/attachments/2015/04/02/2010-07-16_-_olc_aaga_barron_-_al-aulaqi.pdf) strike on a [senior al-Qa'ida member](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/107-3._panetta_declaration_6.10.2015_0.pdf), Anwar al-awlaki was the Chief of external operations. He was responsible for the planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the US and allied nations. He was most infamous for his pivotal role in AQAP's attempt to blow up a US airliner, bound for Detroit on December 25, 2009. The Government's [preferance was to capture him](https://fas.org/irp/eprint/doj-lethal.pdf), but it was not feasible—and was deemed continuing to be an imminent threat.
His son was killed in this strike, but was not made the target. In Janurary 2017, Trump approved a Special Forces raid in Yemen. Media alleged that among the [4-12 civilians killed](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf) (not 30 as media/NGOs claim), was Anwar's 8 year old daughter. However, declassified documents from ACLU litigation have confirmed no children were killed. [Women were among the combatants](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400-Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.html#document/p1).

- In 2016, Obama released, per EO 13732 Sec. 3, data concerning High Value Target CT missions Outside Areas of Active Hostilities.
[The first](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF) report covers from Jan 2009 to Dec 2015. It shows that there was a total of 473 strikes with a total of between 2372-2581 combatants killed and only between 64-117 civilians killed. Following this, the [2016](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Summary-of-2016-Information-Regarding-United-States-Counterterrorism-Strikes-Outside-Areas-of-Active-Hostilities.pdf) report was issued, giving us: 53 total strikes. With 431-441 combatants killed and only 1 civilian killed. Both records make clear to refute the allegations that any "military-aged male" in area of target is deemed a combatant. To quote, "Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants."

- In 2011, Dictator and criminal, Muammar Gaddafi, due to peaceful protests caused by the Arab Spring started to slaughter innocent, paceful civilians with [lethal force](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Libya%20S%20PV%206528.pdf). For months he threatened to slaughter civilians—to the international communities warnings to not follow through. He did. Sending his forces out. Under UNSC Resolution 1973, a [no-fly zone](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/2013/pubs/the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization-and-libya-reviewing-operation-unified-protector/) was established. This [resolution](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Wings-Over-Libya%3A-The-No-Fly-Zone-in-Legal-Schmitt/822ce0de5bb2451fe0ab967436b555111a156ee8) also provided member states to use [all neccisary means](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2011/04/31/authority-military-use-in-libya_0.pdf) to [enforce compliance](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/204673-united-states-activities-in-libya-6-15-11.html). The intervention by the international community was seen as [popular](http://news.gallup.com/poll/156539/opinion-briefing-libyans-eye-new-relations-west.aspx) by Libyans. The [United States](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/us-assistance-to-egypt-tunisia-and-libya) and the international community has since been [addressing](https://ly.usembassy.gov/the-us-commits-6-million-usd-in-humanitarian-assistance-to-libya-for-the-covid-19-response/) matters [since](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33142.pdf) then.
Gaddafi was also a lover of brutish assassins to kill off dissedents, journalists, human rights activits and even attempts on heads of state and soon-to-be-rulers of Kingdoms. Thanks to the NSA, with new authorities granted under the Patriot Act, and other traditional SIGINT and hard work, and made public thanks to Snowden—we can see just one such assassination plot was [thwarted](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4389688-The-Saudi-Assassination-Plot-How-It-Was-Thwarted.html). What was the crime? A perceived insult. "This wealth of information tied the plot directly to Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qhadafi."

- From 2001 up to the present day, the drone campaign has resulted in disrupting many terrorist networks, and resulted in very few civilian casualties. Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the confirmation hearing for John Brennan, confirmed as a result of Congressional oversight, that the civilian deaths per year as a result of drone strikes is often in the [single digits](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/11331.pdf). Lethal strikes are only sought if [capture of HVTs is not feasible](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download). Leaked documents from the Intercept confirm that these missions (including ground raids) result in very few civilian casualties. From September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2012 in Afghanistan, out of a total of 2,082 missions only 14 civilians were killed or injured. That's 0.67%. Media have incorrectly claimed that these documents show a 90% civilian casualty rate from drone strikes. They neither are specific about drones nor, as shown, have a 90% percentile—only a 0.67%.
Another document leaked confirms the time and care taken into approving each strike. Missions can only be approved by POTUS if the host nation consents. See [slide 6](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460856-small-footprint-operations-may-2013.html) and [slides 41 and 42](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460855-small-footprint-operations-february-2013.html).
From these, a picture starts to emerge:
  - The “average approval time” for a proposed strike under the AUMF process was 79 days. Even excluding the single longest approval, presumably an unrepresentative outlier, the average was 58 days. The fastest approval was 27 days.
  - These approvals were preceded by lengthy periods of gathering and analyzing intelligence on the targets—an average of six years.
  - Four out of 24 proposed concepts of operations covered by the study were disapproved under the AUMF review process.
  - The process for approving strikes under the AUMF “requires significant intel/ISR to justify (and maintain) approvals.” “Relatively few, high-level terrorists meet criteria for targeting” under this process. (Note that this isn’t a press release touting the program’s robust oversight; it’s an internal DOD assessment, written from the perspective of operators for whom a laborious approval process is an obstacle rather than a virtue.)
  - These “[p]olitical constraints” make these operations “challenging” and “fundamentally different from what we’ve experienced in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

- On 3 October, 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U accidently missidentified the Kunduz Trauma Centre, operated by Doctors without Borders. Per an [independent investigation](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2819730/RESPONSIVE-DOCUMENTS.pdf), "The ground force and aircrew were unaware theaircrew was firing on a hospital throughout the course of the engagement." This was caused due to technical and human error. "Due to the early launch, the aircrew did not have the typical information it would have on a mission. While enroute to Kunduz, one of the aircraft's critical communications systems failed, resulting in the aircraft's inability to recieve and transmit certain critical information to multiple command headquaters." While tragic—this is not a war crime. While hospitals are indeed protected buildings under international law, there are caveats: 1. A building can lose its protected status. 2. A building can become [duel-status](https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/documents/AFD-081009-011.pdf), see page 84 of this scholarly paper—and yet, it's a [real thing, see page 6 of this investigation](https://archive.org/details/informal-ar-15-6-investigation-findings-and-recommendations-for-the-al-hawijah), not just in academic theory. If part of the building is used by combatants while the rest by civilians, only that area may be targeted. 3. An accident. Since the tribunals of WW2, there has been a principle formed known as the Rendulic standard. To quote from the [2020 updated Operational Law Handbook](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/operational-law-handbook_2020.pdf), "The “Rendulic Rule:”  The Rendulic case also stands for a broader standard regarding liability for battlefield acts: commanders and personnel should be evaluated based on information reasonably available at the time of decision...There may be situations where, because of incomplete intelligence or the failure of the enemy to abide by the LOAC, civilian casualties occur.  Example:  The Iraqi Al Firdos C3 Bunker.  During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), U.S. military planners identified this Baghdad bunker as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters.  The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths.  Was there a violation of the LOAC?  Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces.  Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective.  Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made."

- On November 25, 2010 media alleged, that, according to local sources: US Navy SEALs and Special Forces killed 6 civilians in Shah Wali Khot, having them tied back to back then burned them alive. The allegation was independently [investigated](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIA_RR_Files/5%20USC%20552(a)(2)(D)Records/Shah%20Wali%20Kot%20Afghanistan%20Investigation%202010/Shah%20Wali%20Kot,%20Afghanistan%20Investigation%202010.pdf), and found to be a Taliban hoax. The District govenor also confirmed this—and his testimony was independently verified by HUMINT reporting, as well as by other Village elders.

- In 2010, Chelsea Manning leaked what became known as the 'Iraq war logs', however, it's worth noting that the vast maority of these leaks are in plain-text format. So while the [damaged caused was great](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3933088-Department-of-Defense-Final-Report-of-the.html)—the actual things that matter, to the concerned activity/member of public is the CIVCAS numbers. Sadly, no one is able to independently verify and confirm the plain-text files are accurate. Even worse, some stories don't even cite to the plain-text files on wikileaks site. 

- 12 February 2010 in Gardez District, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, news reports had claimed US Special Forces deliberately killed a pregnant woman, and covering it up. An independent investigation was ordered to answer two principle questions:
  - 1) Did the ground force deliberately mislead its higher headquaters in initial reports regarding this incident? 
  - 2) Did the ground force attempt to hide the circumstances surrounding the casualties by alterng, tampering with, and/or cleaning up the incident scene? 
 
  The investigation [concludes](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2849845-Gardez-FOIA.html) that the answer to both of these questions is "No" and recommends no disciplinary action against the assault force members. The facts gathered in this investigation indicate that ground forces were unaware that the famles were killed when they engaged Mohad Zahir after he emerged from a building in the compound with an AK-47 pointed at the assault force on the roof.

- In 4 May 2009, Bala Balouk District, Farah Province, Afghanistan—The Special Operations Marines (MARSOC) & Afghan SF units called in CAS with (4) F/A-18F strikes. Another (3) strikes were called in for a B-1B Bomber. Civilian casualties resulted because of the complex environment: "The use of military force in this engagement with the Taliban was an appropriate means to destroy that enemy threat within the requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  However, the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimize accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties. Throughout the conduct of this operation, the Ground Force Commander' s (GFC) ability to break contact was hampered by the effects of direct fire contact with a significant enemy force, a  lengthy effort to medically evacuate (MEDEVAC) U.S. and Afghan critically injured personnel by helicopter, and persistent, real-time intelligence on the enemy's continuing efforts to maneuver, mass, re-arm, and re-attack friendly forces from within the village. The independent [investigation](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=35748) concluded that the Laws of Armed Conflict were followed. At least 26 civilians were killed. Around 78 Taliban were killed.


- On 22 August, 2008, US Close Air Support killed 33 civilians in Azizabad, Afghanistan. US MARSOC and Afghan Special Forces executed a kill/capture of a High Value Target. After successful infiltration, the Afghan/US team recieved hostile force engagement. They requested CAS. Unknown to both US & Afghan forces, the hostile engagement positions were in close proximity to civilians. Allegations that the US/Afghan forces committed violations of the Rules of Engagemen or Law of War during the 21-22 August 2008 firefight resulting in 90 civilian deaths are [unsubstantiated](https://archive.org/details/Azizabad-august-2008-MARSOC/mode/2up). The first investigation concluded there was 6 civilians killed. Subsequent to new information provided by UNAMA, ICRC, etc, the US conducted another, more comprehensive investigation. It found that there were 33 CIVCAS and 22 anti-coalition  millitants died. The independent investigation 28 interviews resulting in more than 20 hours of recorded testimony from Afghan government officials, Afghan village elders, officials from IGOs/NGOs, US and Afghan service members, 236 documents and 11 videos. It also found villager statements heavily inconsistent, and other severe methodological flaws by the NGOs and UNAMA. The second investigation also incorporated FBI forensic teams to aid its efforts.

- Between 2004 and 2007, only [568 civilians](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIA_RR_Files/5%20USC%20552(a)(2)(D)Records/Incidents%20Reports%20or%20Actual%20Civilian%20Deaths%20in%20Iraq/r_TAB%20C%20EOF%20Incidents%20SIGACTS%2005%20Bracketed.pdf) were killed or injured as a result of US forces in Iraq.

- [4 March, 2007](https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/galvin-pentagon-report-1549974003.pdf), Nangarhar Pronvince, Afghanistan, a MSOC-F (a unit of MARSOC, Marine Special Operations Command), "convoy was subject to a complex ambush. Small arms fire, and a Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device approached the convoy at a righ rate o speed and detonated. The convoy defended agaisnt additional near-simultaneous attacks, quickly regrouped, and resumed movement west on Highway A1 using authorised procedures to dispurse the crowds and unblock the road to allowing the convoy to continue its westward route. Within 30 minute of the blast, and the convoy's return to base, internet media reports began surfacing indicating that a colaition convoy had opened fir on civilians, killing and wounding many. An Air Force Colonel was apointed to conduct an investigation into the facts surrounding the incident. The Colonel ignored statements by those in the  convoy, ignored EOD specialists, and placed too much at face valueon alleged witness testimony.
Another investigation was appointed, a formal Court of Inquiry (COI) to independently determine the facts and circumstances relative to the actions of MSOC-F. After hundreds of interviews, a complete examination of the documentary evidence, the COI found the statements and testimony of the personnel in the MSOC-F convoy to be consistent, truthful, and credible. The COI found that MSOC-F Marines defended appropriately and proportionately against the 4 March 2007 enemy ambush, and that a non-governmental organization employee's unbiased testimony independently corroborated the testimony of the MSOC-F personnel. The COI opined that the findings and conclusions found in Col P's investigation run counter to the weight of the evidence considered by the Court. Additionally, Col P never interviewed the Reconnaisance Operations Center (ROC) Watch Officer on duty, nor did he review the ROC log to determine the sequence of events on 4 March to determine exactly what was reported and to whom it was reported. Based on his conclusion that the use of force applied by the personnel in the convoy was excessive, Col P recommened various personnel in the MSOC-F convoy be charged. Col P's investigation was discredited and the magnitude of his errors cannoted be overstated. Col P was in possession of overwhelmingly clear evidence that MSOC-F was ambushed and responded in a discriminate and effective manner. Col P. supressed exculpating evidence and inexplicicably accepted the testimony of Afghans he stopped, apparently randomly, and questioned, making no effort to ascertain the location of the Afghans on 4 Mach 2007 and making no effort to corroborate their statements. Col P did not examine key locations, did not interview any of the Afghans allegedly injured by the Marines, and did not examine the ammunition logs."

- On September 16, 2007, members of Blackwater who were protecting a VIP were rushed into evacuating the VIP after a bomb went off outside the venue they were at. Spooked, the security detail rushed out of the area. Coming to a square, in the high-tensions of what had happened, accidently engaged several civilians. The real issue comes after this occured. The team tried to cover themsleves by replacing parts of the vehicle with one already damaged, to bolster their mistake to the FBI. [They were found out](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/24/opinions/blackwater-defendants-pardon-trump-opinion-oconnor/index.html). Arrested, charged and convicted.

- On August 19, 2007, an article from the Washington Post claimed soldiers committed LOAC violations in what is dubbed as "The Battle of Donkey Island".
 The allegation claimed the US Soldiers shot and killed injured insurgents. The independent [investigation](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIALibrary/cases/00-0001/r_14%20OCT%2007%20VIOL%20OF%20LAWS%20OF%20ARMED%20CONFLICT.pdf) finds the article, while compelling, suffers numerious inaccuracies, that, while don't appear to be intentional by the author, was due to incomplete, contradictory information, and general confusion. Seperately, the investigation finds it likely that noncombatants were killed. But could not determine by who.

- On July 12, 2007, a US Apache helicopter was providing force protection to Bravo Company 2-16. The Company had been in near continious contact from insurgents since dawn. The Apache spotted a group of armed men heading in the direction of Bravo Company. The Apache kept its eye on the group until one person peaked around a corner, knelt, and shouldered what appeared to be an RPG. Indeed, the leaked footage from wikileaks confirms this. After the Apache cleared the building, it was cleared to engage the insurgents. After the dust settled: Unknown to the Apache crew, all but two people turned out to be insurgents—they were two journalists with Reuters. It must be highlighted that these two journalists were not wearing the standard 'press' or 'media' vests, nor did they tell the military they'd be present in an area that had seen fighting for days on end. Among the bodies, there were RPGs, AKMs, and other weapons. There was [no violation of the Laws of War, Rules of Enagement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1506533-30-2nd-brigade-combat-team-15-6-investigation-pdf.html), etc.
The leaker of the footage, and many other records that [put innocent civilians at risk](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3933088-Department-of-Defense-Final-Report-of-the.html) was charged and convicted for a [number of crimes](https://web.archive.org/web/20190304152646/https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/Apps/ACCAOpinions/ACCAOpinions.nsf/ODD/818BA3ADDACC08A28525829E0060B9B1/$FILE/oc-manning,%20be.pdf)

- On March 15, 2006, between 3-9 civilians were killed in a raid on a building that was later destroyed. According to an [independent investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/world/africa/04iht-raid.1880380.html), "Allegations that the troops executed a family living in this safe house, and then hid the alleged crimes by directing an airstrike, are absolutely false, the raid's ground commander had adhered to the rules of engagement."
 
- On November 19, 2005, in Haditha, Iraq: a patrol from Company K, 3d Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), mounted in High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles(HMMWVs), was struck by an IED and recieved some small arms fire near the intersection of Routes Chestnut and Viper in Haditha, Iraq. The patrol suffered one FKIA and two FWIA as a result of the IED attack. During actions taken by the patrol in response to the attack, at least 24 Iraqi civilians were killed near the IED site.
Following standard procedures of condolnce payments sent to family of victims, reporting came in containing allegations of deliberate and wrongful killings by the Marines. On 14 Februrary 2006, the MNC-1 Commander directed Colonel G.A. Watt to conduct an AR 15-6 investigation into the incident. The investigation concluded that there had been no intentional targeting of noncombatants; that overall, throughout the entire engagement, Marines had attempted to distinguish combatants from noncombatants; that the force used was proportional, and that the Marines provided adequate medical care to non-coalition force casualties. His investigation concluded that the insurgents had violated the LOAC essentially by using homes occupied by noncombatants to attack the Marines. Colonel Watt, however, did conclude that Marines had failed to comply with the ROE in that they had failed to postively identify (PID) tagets as legitimate before engaging, resulting in the death of noncombatants. As a result, Colonel Watt recommended further investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) or NCIS.
NCIS investigated this matter and found some evidence that two individuals talked to each other about fabricating their accounts of the incident. However, a new, authoritative, final review known as the [Chiarelli report](https://www.mcmilitarylaw.com/documents/000_mg_bargewell_15-6__haditha_report_.bates.pdf) was established and found, even with the additional evidence provided by NCIS, " as noted, NCIS did uncover evidence that certain squad members coordinated false stories on specific aspects of the incident; however, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the overall deficiencies in reporting and follow-on action—while somtimes perplexing—were not the result of an extensive and orchestrated criminal cover-up throughout the chain of command."

  An Investigating Officer [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/specials/iraq/documents/SharrattReport070607.pdf), examined all evidence presented at an Article 32 hearing, and independently concluded Marines acted in accordance with ROEs, specifically LCpl Sharratt.

- In 2004, allegations of unauthorised detainee abuse poured in from the media, concerning Abu Ghraib. These are not to be confused with the [lawful](https://www.aclu.org/files/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc164.pdf)[*](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/torturefoia/released/082409/olc/2007%20OLC%20opinion%20on%20Interrogation%20Techniques.pdf), [effective](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1377197-ssci-minorityviews.html) means of gaining actionable intelligence by the CIA's [Enhanced Interrogation Techniques](https://archive.org/details/RDI-Brief). By [mid-2004, 155 investigations](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/d20040824finalreport.pdf) into detainee abuse allegations had been completed, resulting in 66 substantiated cases.

- On November 8, 2009, an [investigation](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/FormicaReportRelease.pdf) of US Special Forces at Abu Ghraib found that allegations of detainee abuse were unsubstantiated and contradicted by the evidence. In general, facilities met the standards under international law as well as US law and policy. It did discover some issues, and made recommendations for mandatory corrective training.

- On June 9, 2005, an [investigation](https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/report/2005/d20050714report.pdf) into FBI allegations of detainee abuse was finished. After reviewing a _three-year_ period covering more than _24,000 interrogations_, Furlow and Schmidt identified _three_ interrogation acts that were never approved for use by the government. The investigation revealed no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at Guantanamo Bay.

- A 2005 Navy Inspector General report, also known as the [Church report](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/church_report_1.pdf) concluded, "we examined the 187 DoD investigations of alleged detainee abuse that had been closed as of September 30, 2004. Of these investigations, 71 (or 38%) had resulted in a finding of substantiated detainee abuse, including six cases involving detainee deaths. 8 of the 71 cases occured at GTMO, all of which were relatively minor in their physical nature. Additionally, 130 cases remained open, with investigatins ongoing. Finally, our investigation indicated that commanders are making vigorous efforts to investigate every allegation of abuse—regardless of whether the allegations are made by DoD personnel, civilian contractors, detainees, the ICRC, the local populace, or any other source." One case was removed from this statistical report leaving it to just 70 substantiated. Of the 70, there were only 121 victims. Disciplinary action was taken against a total of 115 personnel. The investigation found no link between approved interrogation techniques and detainee abuse.

- In November, 2004, in Fallujah, Iraq, TF 2-2 provided indirect firesupport to US forces during the battle for Fallujah. During the battle, TF 2-2 lawfully deployed White Phosphorus munitions, described as "shake and bake", to flush out insurgents out of trench lines and spider holes, because of its Psychological impact. To quote from the March 2005 magazine [Field Artillery](https://sill-www.army.mil/fires-bulletin-archive/archives/2005/MAR_APR_2005/MAR_APR_2005_FULL_EDITION.pdf), 'The Fight for Fallujah', "WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE. We fired “shake and bake” missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out." This entry was misquoted by media to allege that US forces were deploying WP munitions against combatants for its incindary and/or chemical effects. 

- On May 12, 2004, CIA Deputy Director McLaughlin, in closed [testimony](https://archive.org/details/may-12-2004-ddcia-testimony) corrected the record to Congress that CIA was not involved in any of the photos seen that leaked to the media, of unauthorised detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. He said, "We are not authorised in the program to do anything like what you have seen in those photographs." As noted by the Office of Medical Services (OMS) on the RDI program during their [review](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5301943/CIA-OMS-Summary.pdf), "The empirical record affirmed effectiveness and, through the presence of OMS, the safety of the program. Finally, critically and urgency  each received case-by-case analysis from CTC. Though imperfect this review nonetheless limited the application of EITs to less than a third of the detainees who came into Agency hands, and further limited the use of the most aggressive techniques to only 5 or 6 of the highest value detainees. A criterion  of"'necessity" also requires that no aggressive measure be used when a lesser measure would suffice."

- In May 2004, US conducted a raid near the Iraq-Syrian border, targeting several HVTs of the Zarqawi network. The NYT and AP alleged this was a wedding where many civilians were killed as a result of the raid. However, Signals, Human and Satellite intelligence as well as forensic and contradictory and inconsistent local testimony during interviews proved this allegation [false](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIA_RR_Files/5%20USC%20552(a)(2)(D)Records/U.S.%20Raid%20Near%20the%20Syrian-Iraq%20Border%20on%2019%20May%2004/r_Responsive_Docs-Facts_Findings-new-Bracketed.pdf).

- On December 10, 2002, a number of US Military personnel (20) were involved in [detainsee abuse](https://archive.org/details/doddoacid-011770) that resulted in the death of two men, one of whom was Dilawar. CIA had no involvement in this matter. 

- On September 23, 2009, an [independent](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Oct/31/2001836211/-1/-1/1/09-INTEL-13.PDF) investigation found that allegations that the DoD, between September 2001 to April 2008 was using "mind-altering drugs" on detainees to be unsubstantiated. Some detainees were medicated to treat diagnosed mental conditions.

- On 30 June, [2002](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207215250/http://www.centcom.mil/News/Reports/Investigation_Oruzgan_Province.htm), in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan, recon and other coalition aircraft came under fire from a number of compounds by AAA batteries. An AC-130 was called in. There were people within this area of Oruzgan Province that regularly aimed and fired of variety of weapons at coalition aircraft. These weapons represented a real threat to coalition forces. As OFT commenced, AAA weapons were fired and, as a result, an AC-130 aircraft, acting properly and in accordance with the rules, engaged the locations of those weapons. Great care was taken to strike only those sites that were actively firing that night. While the coalition regrets the loss of innocent lives, the responsibility for that loss rests with those that knowingly directed hostile fire at coalition forces. The operators of those weapons elected to place them in civilian communities and elected to fire them at coalition forces at a time when they knew there were a significant number of civilians present. 


- On November 2002, Gul Rahman died in CIA detention. An independent [investigation](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006555318.pdf) found that he was not subject to torture or mistreated—that his own actions lead to his death. It reached the following conclusions:
  - >There is no evidence to suggest that Rahman's death was deliberate.
  - >There is no evidence to suggest Rahman was beaten, tortured, poisoned, strangled, or smothered.
  - >Gul Rahman's actions contributed to his own death. By throwing his last meal he was unable to provide his body with a source of fuel to keep warm. Additionally, his violent behavior resulted in his restraint which prevented him from generationg body heat by moving around and brought him in direct contact with the concrete floor leadng to the loss of bodyheat through conduction.
   
   This was also subject to an OIG investigation, and forwarded to DOJ for prosecutoral determination. DOJ notified it would not charge, but would include it in an ongoing special counsel review by the Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. An independent [study](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1377196/cia-response-to-senate-report.pdf) of the RDI program found that in addition to OIG investigations and criminal prosecutions—including the extensive multi-year investigation of RDI activity by a DOJ special prosecutor, which reviewed more than 100 detainee cases—CIA convened six accountability proceedings, either at the directorate or higher level, from 2003 to 2012.
 In total, these reviewed assessed the performance of 30 individuals (staff officers and contractors), and 16 were deemed accountable and sansctioned. OIG conducted two seperate major reviews and at least 29 seperate investigations of alleged misconduct. Some of these reviews were self-initiated by Agency components responsible for managing the program. CIA made numerous referrals to the OIG relating to the conduct of Agency officers and their treatment of detainees, during the life of the program as well as after. When actions appeared to violate criminal prohibitions, referrals were made to the DOJ.
 
  In total, OIG conducted nearly 60 investigations on RDI-related matters. In over 50, OIG found the allegations to be unsubstantiated or otherwise did not make findings calling for accountability review. Of the remaining cases, one resulted in a felony conviction, one resulted in termination of a contractor, and revocation of his security clearances, and six led to accountability reviews.
   
 
- After 9/11, the US passed into law the Patriot Act. [A law that streamlined many already-existing laws at a federal level](https://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/subs/add_myths.htm). It, along with the USA Patriot Improvement Act, [strengthened privacy and civil liberties protections](https://www.justice.gov/archive/911/legal.html)
A detailed overview of one of the PA's provisions can be found [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/750227-patriot-act-section-215-white-paper.html) and a deep-dive [here](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/On-the-Bulk-Collection-of-Tangible-Things.pdf)
For an overall view of surveillance changes post 9/11 see [here](https://www.alston.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/peter-swire-testimony-documents/professorpeterswiretestimonyinirishhighcourtcase.pdf) Chapter 5 details the many means in which the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court holds the Government's feet to the fire, via various mechanisms—via a systematic evaluation of the declassified record. "The  FISC has  been criticized in some media outlets as a “rubber stamp,” particularly  in the  wake  of  the  Snowden  disclosures.This section shows howrecently-declassified materialsare not consistent with that claim. In my view, the FISC exercises effective oversight, backed by constitutional authority, over government applications to conduct surveillance."
The Chapter is divided into four sections: 
   - I. The  newly  declassified  materials  support  theconclusion  that  the  FISC  today provides  independent  and  effective  oversight  over  US  government  surveillance. Especially since the Snowden disclosures, the FISC was criticized in some media outlets as a “rubber stamp.”  This section shows  that  this  claim is  incorrect. It examines  FISC  opinions  illustrating  the court’s care in  reviewing  proposed surveillance.  For many years, an important role of the FISC was to insist that the Department  of  Justiceclearly  document  its  surveillance  requests,  with  the  effect the  Department  would  only  go  through  that  effort  for  high-priority  requests.  Since  the  passage  of  the  USA  FREEDOM  Act,  the  number  of  surveillance applications  that  the  FISC has modified  or  rejected  has,at  least  initially,grownsubstantially,  to  17  percent  of  surveillance  applications  inthe  second  half  of2015.6The section closes  by  showing  the  FISC’s  willingness  to  exercise  its constitutional power to restrict surveillance that it believes is unlawful.
  - II. The FISC monitors compliance with its orders, and has enforced with significant sanctions  in  cases  of  noncompliance.  The FISC’s jurisdiction is not confined to approving   surveillance   applications.      The   FISC   also   monitors   government compliance  and  enforces  its  orders.    This section outlines  the  interlocking  rules, third-party  audits,  and  periodic  reporting  that  provide  the  FISC  with  notice  of compliance  incidents.    It  then  discusses  examples  of  the  FISC’s  responses  to government noncompliance.  FISC  compliance decisions have resulted in (1) the National  Security  Agency(NSA)electing  to  terminate  an Internet  metadata collection   program;   (2)substantial   privacy-enhancing   modifications   to   the Upstream  program;  (3)  the  deletion  of  all  data  collected  via  Upstream  prior  to October  2011;  and  (4)  a  temporary  prohibition  on  the  NSA  accessing  one  of  its own databases. 

   - III. In  recent  years,  both  the  FISC  on  its  own  initiative  and  new  legislation  have greatly increased transparency.  Under the original structure of FISA, enacted in 1978,  the  FISC in many respects was a “secret court” –the  public  knew  of  its existence  but  had  very  limited  information  about  its  operations.    This section describes  how,  in  recent  years,  the  FISC  itself  began  to  release  more  of  its  own opinions and procedures, and the USA FREEDOM Act now requires the FISC to disclose  important  interpretations  of  law.It  also  discusses  how  litigation  before the FISC resulted intransparency reporting rights, and how these rights have been codified into US surveillance statutes.

   - IV. The FISC now receives and will continue to benefit from briefing by parties other than  the  Department  of  Justice  in  important  cases.   Originally,  the  main  task  of the FISC was to issue an individual wiretap order, such as for one Soviet agent at a time. Aswith other search warrants, these proceedings were ex parte, with the Department of Justicepresenting its evidence to the FISC for review. After 2001, the  FISC  played  an  expanded  role  in  overseeing  entire  foreign  intelligence programs, such as under Section 215 and Section 702.  In light of the more legally complex issues that these programs can raise, there was an increasing recognition that  judges  would  benefit  from  briefing  by  parties  other  than  the Department  of Justice.    This section reviews  newly  declassified materials concerning  how  the FISC  began  to  receive  such  briefing  of  its  own  initiative.    Prior  to  the  USA FREEDOM Act,  the  FISC  created  some  opportunities  for privacy  experts  and communication services  providers  to  brief  the  court.    The  USA FREEDOM Act has created a set of six experts in privacy and civil liberties who will have access to classified information and will brief the court in important cases.
No country on earth comes as close to transparency or to the protectinons of privacy and civil liberties compared to the US, [even for non-citizens](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5003660-PCLOB-PPD28-Report.html) "PPD-28 was a milestone. It responded to an important and difficult issue in US foreign intelligence practice: How to conduct necessarily robust collection of communications data outside the United States while respecting the privacy rights of non-US persons — privacy rights inherent, according to the long-standing policy of the United States, in all human beings. By codifying for the first time significant limits on intelligence activities affecting non-US persons outside the United States, the directive gave substance to our government's claim to respect the human rights of all individuals. It affirmed and strengthened the role of the United States as the world's leader by (1) establishing express limits on intelligence activities, even as it reaffirmed the need for robust intelligence capabilities; (2) promoting transparency about those limits; and the (3) establishing a greater degree of equivalence, where feasible, between protections for the personel information of US persons and non-US persons."

   Indeed the above review said, "We urge the CIA _not_ to apply the PPD-28's retention rules to [blank] unless it develops a way to avoid over-application of the Directive." and that, "The CIA, for example, has decided to apply PPD-28 to a broad range of activities, including some that it explicity acknowledged "are not SIGINT." Of course, PPD-28 didn't change NSA's activities that much, as the report notes, "NSA's past practice was to limit all signals intelligence activities, including the dissemination of personal information of non-US persons in disseminated SIGINT products, to those necessary to accomplish its foreign intelligence mission."

   One may be forgiven to think this is "just on paper", alas, that is not so. Thousands of declassified pages confirm that these governing laws, policy and guidance are all followed. Where honest mistakes are made, they are corrected promptly. 
Lets look at 4 such records, that cover, in total, almost decades—from 9/11 to 2019.
   
  - [ST-09-0002](https://archive.org/details/JointIGreviewPSP/page/n129/mode/2up?view=theater) "NSA activity conducted under the PSP was authorised by Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders by 17 Janurary 2007, when NSA stopped operating under PSP authority. The NSA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) detected _no intentional misuse of Program authority._"
   
   - [18th Joint Assessment](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/18th_Joint_Assessment.pdf) "Consistent with previous Joint Assessments, no instances of intentional circumvention or violation of those procedures were found during this reporting period."
   
   - [SID Oversight & Compliance](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/Letter%20from%20David%20S.%20Kris%2C%20Assistant%20Attorney%20General%2C%20to%20the%20Honorable%20John%20D.%20Bates%2C%20Presiding%20Judge%2C%20United%20States%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Court.pdf) "Conducted a complete (100 percent) audit of all PR/TT metadata queries, and this audit has confirmed that there has been no inappropriate access to the sensitive PR/TT metadata via intelligence analysis tools. Compliance audits have determined that the EAR has prevented all queries on non-RAS approved identifiers from accessing the metadata."
   
   - [Several](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2809657/Nsa-Ig-Bulk-Nyt-15-0811.pdf) NSA OIG reports confirm in monthly reporting instances of finding no non-compliance. Though it finds issues here and there, and provides recommendations. Not a single case of misuse/abuse was found. 

  None of the above involved "warrantless wiretapping either. It was always the case that to do surveillance on a US person, located in the US or outside the US, or an alian within the US: A warrant is required. PRISM/Upstram collection under FAA Sec. 702 cannot target USPs and are annually approved by FISC. The bulk collection of CDRs also wasn't a wiretap, and required Court order every 90 days. The above records provide details on this, but the following do as well:
 
   - [ST-14-0002](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/3IGReports-Sealed.pdf) Contains 3 OIG reviews but 14-0002  Covers 702 and 215 authorities. p. 224 for 702's PRISM/Upstream. p. 155 for bulk CDR.

  - [ODNI Infographic](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/Section702-Basics-Infographic.pdf) Provides a very basic rundown of how 702 works, oversight, value.

  - [Covers 702 targeting procedures](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/icotr/Assessment_Oversight_Compliance_702_Targeting_Procedures-Redacted.pdf) A small read (12 pages).

  - [Fleisch Decl.](https://fas.org/sgp/jud/statesec/jewel-fleisch.pdf) and [Bonanni Decl.](https://fas.org/sgp/jud/statesec/jewel-bonanni-redacted.pdf)
 These two are another good overview, though more basic to an extent, of the evolution from TSP to 702 and 215 authorities, etc.
also specifically debunks the notion of "key words"

- It has been alleged by several media outlets and NGOs that the CIA had several of the following individuals in CIA custody:
  - Khalid Al-Zawahiri
  - Osama Bin Yousaf
  - Qari Saifullah Akhtar
  - Walid bin Azmi
  - Iban Al Yaquti al Sheikh al-Sufiyan
  - Amir Hussein Abdullah al-Misri
  - Safwan al-Hasham
  - Jawad al Bashar
  - Saif Al-Islam Al-Masri
 
  A [review](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20392756-savage-nyt-foia-redacted-durham-report-to-holder-on-cia-detainees-not-in-cia-custody) of FBI, CIA and DoD documents confirms none of these individuals were in CIA custody.

- In 2003, the US legally invaded Iraq pursaunt to UNSC Resolution 1441. This was preceeded by years of Iraqi non-complinace with prior resolutions + a ceasefire agreement. The popular myth is that the US and UK Governments lied to justify invasion. However, a review of the declassified record shows this claim to be a haox:
 [Response to the independent report of the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-intelligence-and-security-committee-report-on-iraqi-weapons-of-mass-destruction) concerning Iraq WMDs and in examining  whether  the  available intelligence,  which  informed  the  decision  to  invade  Iraq,  was  adequate  and  properly assessed and whether it was accurately reflected in Government publications. 
The Committee found the following key conclusions:
  - 1. The September dossier was endorsed by the whole JIC (ISC Report, paragraph 106).
  - 2. The  September  dossier  was  founded  on  the  intelligence  assessments  then available (paragraph 107). 
  - 3. The September dossier was not ’sexed up’ by Alastair Campbell or anyone else (paragraph 108). 
  - 4. The  JIC  was  not  subjected  to  political  pressures.  Its  independence  and impartiality were not compromised in any way (paragraph 108)
 
  A Senate Intelligence Committee study, titled, _[Whether public statements regarding Iraq by US Govt Officials were substantiated by Intelligence information](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/110345.pdf)_ found that all public statements by US officials were indeed supported by the intelligence at the time, see page 117 of PDF/133 of scan.

  Another [study](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf) by the same commitee found that no intelligence was fabricated, or skewed or that analysts were pressured to making an assessment.
   >"The Committee was not presented with  any evidence that intelligence  analysts changed their judgments  as a result of political pressure, altered  or produced  intelligence products to conform  with Administration  policy, or that  anyone even attempted to coerce, influence  or pressure  analysts to do so.  When asked whether  analysts were pressured  in any way to alter their assessments  or make their judgments  conform  with Administration policies, not a single analyst answered yes."

  It has been alleged in the media and by pundists, that then SecDef Rumsfeld created a "rouge intel op" to justify invading Iraq, and created false intel reports, etc. This conspiracy theory was debunked by a [2007](https://archive.org/details/IraqPreWarActivitiesResponse/mode/2up) DODIG report, and management comments. 
 
- Under the September 17, 2001 Memorandum of Notification, the CIA engaged in a covert program to hunt down, capture, detaine, and later interrogate HVT AQ detainees. This program exampled effective oversight improvements over time, indeed, [Congressional staffers](https://ciasavedlives.com/bdr/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program.pdf) notes that one CIA Black Site, "upon departing... compared the facility to both the US Military detention facility at Bagram and the facility at Guantanamo Bay. Both remarked that the facility "was markedly cleaner, healthier, more humane and better administered facility."
An independent [audit](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4454538/Document-20-CIA-Office-of-the-Inspector-General.pdf) of CIA facilities notes, "Detainees at facilities operated by CTC/RDG are provided essentials of shelter, clothing, mourishment, and hygiene; medical and psychological examinations and treatment; limited dental and vision care; opportunities for physical exercise and intellectual, religious, and recreational pursuits; and daily contact with facility staff. Detainees are held in solitary confienment in climate-controlled, lighted, aboveground, windowless cells that are equipped with a mattress, a sink, and a toilet. None of the detainees showed any apparent physical signs of mistreatment."[1](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20887990-00000000-cia-hvd-program)

  Even within CTC, any detainees reporting to be mistreated and use of unauthorised techniques were thoroughly, independently investigated. Indeed, CTC/Legal [forwarded](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120073426/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/0006541723.pdf) Mr. Hawsawi's complaints to the OIG. They, inturn, forwarded it to the DOJ, as the allegations as alleged, if true—would be in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. 2340A Torture. All investigations found no evidence to support the allegations, however, still updated the DOJ on the matter in 2006. This, among others, shows the Agency is not afraid to self-report allegations even by detainees for investigation. 
It was also falsely claimed by Dianna Feinstein that the CIA spied on her Committee when conducting their review of the program. This was thoroughly debunked by an independent [review](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1502797/redacted-12-2014-agency-accountability-board.pdf).

- After the terrorist attack on 9/11, the US responded by sending in [small CIA/Special Forces teams](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf) into Afghanistan. They knew their enemy. "In CTC/SO, we operated on the understanding that the enemy was not Afghanistan, not the Afghan people, and not even the Taliban as a government institution. The enemy was al-Qaida, particularly the terrorists' command and control network and their specific Taliban leadership allies."
US later invaded Afghanistan. [Legal under US domestic & international law](https://archive.org/details/warinafghanistan85schm)
The US invaded Iraq because of its [non-compliance with UNSC Resolution 1441](https://archive.org/details/wariniraqlegalan86pedr)

- The First Gulf War, led by the US to repel the illegal invasion & occupation of the Iraqi military from Kuwait was both devestatingly effective, and in [full compliance with international law](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=638&skin=2021), as emphasis was placed on [reducing civilian casualties and collateral damage to infrastructure as much as possible](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=664&skin=2021) this includes the "highway of death". As the final report to Congress notes:
  >"In the early hours of 27 February, CENTCOM received a report that a concentration of vehicles was forming in Kuwait City. It was surmised that Iraqi forces were preparing to depart under the cover of darkness. CINCCENT was concerned about the redeployment of Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, fearing they could join with and provide reinforcements for Republican Guard units west of Kuwait City in an effort to stop the Coalition advance or otherwise endanger Coalition forces. The concentration of Iraqi military personnel and vehicles, including tanks, invited attack. CINCCENT decided against attack of the Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, since it could lead to substantial collateral damage to Kuwaiti civilian property and could cause surviving Iraqi units to decide to mount a defense from Kuwait City rather than depart. Iraqi units remaining in Kuwait City would cause the Coalition to engage in military operations in urban terrain, a form of fighting that is costly to attacker, defender, innocent civilians, and civilian objects.The decision was made to permit Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait City and engage them in the unpopulated area to the north. In the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm, some questions were raised regarding this attack, apparently on the supposition that the Iraqi force was retreating. The attack was entirely consistent with military doctrine and the law of war. The law of war permits the attack of enemy combatants and enemy equipment at any time, wherever located, whether advancing, retreating, or standing still. Retreat does not prevent further attack. At the small-unit level, for example, once an objective has been seized and the position consolidated, an attacking force is trained to fire upon the retreating enemy to discourage or prevent a counterattack." 

- During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), [U.S. military](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=649&skin=2021&q1=Al%20Firdus%20bunker) planners identified Al Firdos C3 Bunker (Amiriyah shelter),  as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters.  The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths.  Was there a violation of the LOAC?  Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces.  Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective. Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made. A review of the targeting policies at the time were determined to be proper. 

- In 1991, the United States and allied countries [under UNSCR resolution & strict Rules of Enagement](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1459&context=ils), imposed 3 no-fly zone operations to secure the Kurdish people from slaughter at the hands of the brutal Iraqi regime. This measure allowed the Allied nations to also provide humanitarian aid. 

- In August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s army invaded Kuwait and consequently the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq.
Saddam lied about the effect of these sanctions, by manipulating census data. A [paper](https://gh.bmj.com/content/2/2/e000311) published in BMJ Global Health confirms, "Since 2003, however, several more surveys dealing with child mortality have been undertaken. Their results show no sign of a huge and enduring rise in the under-5 death rate starting in 1991. It is therefore clear that Saddam Hussein’s government successfully manipulated the 1999 survey in order to convey a very false impression—something that is surely deserving of greater recognition."

- In 1988, a US Navy ship accidentally shot down civilian airline flight 655. An [independent investigation](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6660400-1988-Iran-Plane-Crash-Fp.html#document/p1) determined that Iran was at fault for the tragedy. Its actions that day led to the incident. "On the morning of 3 July, MONTGOMERY observed seven IRGC small boats approaching a Pakistani vessel. The number shortly thereafter grew to 13 and they began to challenge nearby merchantmen. VINENNES was ordered to the area to support MONTGOMERY and launched a helicopter to reconnoiter the scene. In the progress the helicopter was fired upon. VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY closed the general areas of the small boats. Two of the boats turned toward  VINCENNES  and MONTGOMERY while the others began to maneuver erratically. These actions were interpreted as manifesting hostile intent and both ships, after being given permission, engaged. This action, involving high speed course changes and gunfire at close range, was still in progress when Air Bus 655 took off from the joint military/civilian airfield at Bandar Abbas and headed toward Dubai. It is hard to overemphasize the fact that Bandar Abbas is also a military airfield. The Air Bus was probable not informed of the surface action taking place in the Strait. Informed or not, Flight 655 logically appeared to have a direct relationship to the ongoing surface engagement.

  During the critical seven minutes that Flight 655 was airborne, Captain Rogers and his CIC Watch team were integrating a multitude of ongoing events. Specifically, VINCENNES was engaged in a high-speed surface battle with at least two groups of Iranian small boasts—all of which had the capability to inflict serious damage. At the same time, she was monitoring one of her helos which was airborne and had already come under attack.  CIC was also tracking an Iranian P-3 military aircraft airborne approximately 60 nautical miles to the northwest which was presenting a classic  targeting profile. (i.e., furnishing information to an attack aircraft.) In the midst of this highly charged environment, an unknown aircraft took off from a joint military/civilian airport on a flight path headed directly toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. This was the same airfield from which Iran had launched F-4s in support of an attack on US naval forces on 18 April. This unknown aircraft was 27 minutes behind any scheduled commerical airline departure from Bandar Abbas airport. Although it was flying within a known commercial air corridor, it was off centerline some 3 or 4 miles, which was not the usual centerline profile for commercial air traffic previously monitored by VINCENNES. Moreover, its mid-range altitude was consistent with either a hostile or commerical aircraft. VINCENNES could detect no radar emanations from the contact which might identify it, but was reading a Mode III IFF squawk. This situation was confused somewhat when a Mode II IFF squawk was detected and the aircraft was identified as an F-14. Complicating the picture was an Iranian P-3 to the west which was in excellent position to furnish targeting information to an attacking aircraft. More importantly, the unknown contact continued at a gradually increasing speed on a course headed toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. It failed to respond to repeated challenges from VINCENNES over both military and international emergency distress frequencies.
  
- It has been alleged that the CIA aided the Taliban and AQ, or extremist elements of the Mujahideen; funded and trained Bin Ladin, etc. These are all false, but rely on a partial truth. The US did aid the Mujahideen to fight off the illegal Soviet invasion/occupation. 
 [In summary](https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html):
  >U.S. covert aid went to the Afghans, not to the "Afghan Arabs."

  >The "Afghan Arabs" were funded by Arab sources, not by the United States.

  >United States never had "[any relationship whatsoever](https://web.archive.org/web/20191101205458/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/cia-the-war-on-terrorism/terrorism-faqs.html)" with Osama bin Laden.

  >The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Arab backing for the "Afghan Arabs," and bin Laden's own decisions "created" Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, not the United    States.

  It should also be [noted](https://www.cia.gov/static/9fa9520134e1c2f3068001de69c9964b/Curator-Pocket-History-CIA.pdf) that the [CIA/SF](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf) units the US sent in after 9/11, met up with these very same moderates they helped in the 80s, to fight AQ and the Taliban.
  
- In 1980s, US had no involvement in the Turkish coup. According to the list's own wiki citation, the alleged source for the claim clarified in a June 2003 interview, "I did not say to Carter "Our boys did it." It is totally a tale, a myth, It is something Birand fabricated. He knows it, too. I talked to him about it." And, "General Kenan Evren said 'the US did not have pre-knowledge of the coup but we informed them of the coup 2 hours in advance due to our soldiers coinciding with the American community JUSMAT that is in Ankara.'" 

- Despite many allegations, no evidence exists that the US supported either or both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict.
It is [confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20170124020754/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90T01298R000300670001-8.pdf) that the USSR was a major supplier for chemical agents and other gear to Iraq. CIA only, naturally, [monitored](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81B00401R000500030002-5.pdf) the conflict—it is after all—the _Central Intelligence Agency_.

- In 1953, the CIA spearheaded an operation to aid the Shah, who legally dismissed Mossadeq. Pundits and historical revistionists claim Mossadegh was "democratically elected" this is furthest from the truth. Indeed, he was widely seen as unopular, and the "election" is widely considered a sham. As noted in the most comprehensive & authoritative [study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4375470-Document-2-Zendebad-Shah.html) of the CIA's involvement, the author concludes,
"Did the CIA act against a legitimate leader enjoying popular support? Although there is no doubt that Mossadeq captured the imagination of segments of Iranian society with the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, his political support dwindled steadily. By August 1953 he did not command mass support. The Tudeh and splinters of the National Front were the only political parties willing to support him. The pro-Shah sentiments of the Tehran crowds on 19 August 1953 were genuine. Although CIA had a hand in starting the demonstrations, they swelled spontaneously and took on a life of their own that surprised even Kermit Roosevelt. By August 1953, Mossadeq's support was vociferous by increasingly narrow. The Shah's support was latent but deep, and took a crisis—like the news of Tudeh demonstrators pulling down the Shah's statutes—to awaken. Khorramabad residents, for example, wildly rejoiced at hearing of the monarch's return. Before dismissing reports like those from  Khorramabad as propaganda, it must be remembered that CIA was able to influence directly events only in the capital city, and there only barely. Kermit Roosevelt had neither the money nor the agents to initiate the kinds of demonstrations that took place in Iran's widely separated cities.

  Did CIA restore the Shah to his throne? TPAJAX did not "restore" the Shah to his throne either technically or constitutionally. Although the Iranian monarch left Tehran during the operation, he never abdicated. Mossadeq's argument that the Shah's _firmans_ were invalid was disingenuous. The Iranian constitution gave the Shah the right to dismiss the Prime Minister. As soon as Mossadeq refused to obey the Shah's legal order, he was rebelling against constitutional authority. From that point on, TPAJAX became an operation to remove the usurper Mossadeq and permit Zahedi, the legitimate Prime Minister, to take office. Unlike Mossadeq's government, Zahedi's government recognized the Shah's constitutional authority."
  
- In 1949, the US had no involvement in the Syrian coup. The lists own' [wiki citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1949_Syrian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Political_context_and_allegations_of_U.S._involvement) makes it clear it's just a mere allegation, with contradictory narratives from the same author of several books. Nothing in the documentary record exists to even suggest a possible connection.

### Western Hemisphere

- In 2004, at the [request](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/29990.htm) of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, the United States facilitated his safe departure, after resigning.

- Haiti, September 1994, US Military forces were ordered to execute [Operation Uphold Democracy](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/kretchikw.pdf). The objective was to return to office the democratically elected President, and to facilitate a stable and secure environment in which democratic institutions could take hold. This was successful. President Aristide reassumed his duties, the Junta that ousted him was forced to leave the country, and national elections were successfully held in 1996. The democratic process there was given the opportunity to succeed due, in large part, to Operation Uphold Democracy. 

- In June 1996, the President's Intelligence Oversight Board issued its _[Report on the Guatemala review](https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214324/http://www.ciponline.org/iob.htm)_ which examined CIA's interaction with security services on human rights issues concluded:
 "The human rights records of the Guatemalan security services—the D-2 and the Department of Presidental Security (known informally as "Archivos." after one of its predeccesor organizations)—were generally known to have been reprehensible by all who were familiar with Guatemala. US policy-makers knew of both CIA's liason with them and the service's unsavory reputations. The CIA endeavored to improve this behavior of the Guatemalan services through frequent and close contact and by stressing the importance of human rights—insisiting, for example, that Guatemalan military intelligence training include human rights instruction. The station officers assigned to Guatemala and the CIA headquaters officials whom we interviewed believe that the CIA's contact with the Guatemalan services helped improve attitudes towards human rights.
 
   DO Guidance on Human Rights:
   The CIA's Directorate of Operations (DO) and Guatemala station were clearly aware of the potential for human rights violations by assets and liason contacts. In November 1988, the DO's Latin America (LA) division provided a guidance cable to its Central American stations:
   >"Point we would like to make is that we must all become sensitized to the importance of respecting human rights, and we must ensure that those assets and resource we direct and/or fund are equally sensitive. The issue will only become more important, and we serve our objectives best if we remember that if we ignore the importance of the human rights issue in the final analysis we do a great damage to our mission. We are under great scrutiny.
   >Finally, aside from the legal and policy considerations which are constant in any allegations concerning violations of human rights we also recognize a basic moral obligation. We are Americans and we must reflect American values in the conduct of our buisness. We are all inherently opposed to the violation of human rights. Those who work with us in one capacity or another must also respect these values."
   
    The IOB also notes:
   >"US policy objectives in Guatemala from 1984 to the present--the period we reviewed--included supporting the transition to and strengthening of civilian democratic government, furthering human rights and the rule of law, supporting economic growth, combating illegal narcotics trafficking, combating the communist insurgency, and advancing the current peace process between the government and the guerrillas."
   >"The CIA's successes in Guatemala in conjunction with other US agencies, particularly in uncovering and working to counter coups and in reducing the narcotics flow, were at times dramatic and very much in the national interests of both the United States and Guatemala.
   
    The CIA's Independent Inspector General issued a multi-volume series on Guatemala. [Volume 1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000690161.pdf) concludes similar.
  
  The Department of Defense also issued its 1995 [report](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Sep/11/2001806396/-1/-1/1/REPORT%20TO%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE%20ON%20DOD%20ACTIVITIES%20IN%20GUATEMALA%20(U).PDF), 'Guatemala Review - Report to the Secretary of Defense on DoD Activities in Guatemala. which found that US Policy towards Guatemala was:
  >Promoting a stable democratic government to include ending the Marxist insurgency;
  >eliminating human rights abuses;
  >responding to the economic and social needs of the Guatemalan people; and
  >reducing drugs and drug trafficking.

  Based on the documentation reviewed, all significant DoD programs and activities in Guatemala from 1980 to 1995 were within the stated US Policy objectives:
  >There were 1,366 deployments to Guatemala during the period. Involving at least 25,021 DoD personnel. US military personnel performed humanitarian and civic action exercises designed to demonstrate the role of the military in stabilizing a democratic government and improving the economic and social welfare of the Guatemalan people.
  >Since 1990, DoD personnel have supported the Drug Enforcement Administration's effort to interdic narcotics trafficking in Guatemala by transporting law enforcement personnel, detecting suspected trafficking activity, providing intelligence support and assisting in planning counterdrug operations.
  >The DoD security assistance program during the period totalled 28 million in grant aid and 3.384 million in International Military Euducation and Training. With the exception of one UH-1 helicopter in 1983, no major end items were provided to the Government of Guatemala.

- The CIA had no involvement drug trafficking has alleged by Gary Webb. Several independent investigations could not substantiate the claims and found contradictory information to said allegations, such as when CIA learned of such illegal activities, they tipped off local Law Enforcement to take action.
  - [CIA's independent Inspector General](https://web.archive.org/web/20201204233325/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-1998/pr100898.html) "[Volume I](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=725779) of the report, which was issued on January 29, 1998, found no evidence that would substantiate The San Jose Mercury News allegations that the CIA had any involvement with Ricky Ross, Oscar Danilo Blandon, or Juan Norwin Meneses, or in cocaine trafficking in California to raise funds for the Contras."
  
  - [A House Intelligence Committee investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20170427105948/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-2000/house_pr05112000.html) from 2000, "In summarizing its findings, the Committee stated: 'The allegations of the ‘Dark Alliance’ series warranted an investigation, and the Committee performed its role mindful of the thousands of American lives that have been lost to the scourge of crack cocaine. Based on its investigation, involving numerous interviews, reviews of extensive documentation, and a thorough and critical reading of other investigative reports, the Committee has concluded that the evidence does not support the implications of the San Jose Mercury News—that the CIA was responsible for the crack epidemic in Los Angeles or anywhere else in the United States to further the cause of the Contra war in Central America."
"Concluding its investigation into allegations of CIA complicity in drug trafficking to the United states during the 1980’s, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) today released a detailed report which concludes that evidence does not support those allegations, made initially in a newspaper series entitled "Dark Alliance."

  - [DOJ's Independent Inspector General report](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/9712/index.htm) concludes the same.

- In responding to requests from El Salvador, the US aided covertly and overtly, resistance movements to the [anti-democratic](https://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/documents/d-all-19.pdf) regime in Nicaragua. Nicaragua was engaging in a massive, illegal covert program—backed by the USSR, to overthrow the democratic government in El Salvador and surround countries. To expand on this further, I'll quote at length from the ICJ dissenting [opinion](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/70/070-19860627-JUD-01-09-EN.pdf) on the matter. It's worth noting the dissenting opinion is more than twice as long as the judgement, and revists the factual and legal record before it. Applying far more care:
  "I am profoundly pained to say, I dissent from this judgement because i believe that, in effect, it adopts the false testimony of representatives of the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua on a matter which, in my view, is material to its disposition...
The facts are in fundamental controversy. I find the Court's statement of the facts to be inadequate, in that it is sufficiently sets out the facts which have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to the United States, while insufficiently sets out the facts which should have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to Nicaragua. 

  Without any pretence, still less actuality, of provocation, Nicaragua since 1979 has assisted and persisted in efforts to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by providing large-scale, significant and sustained assistance to the rebellion in El Salvador - a rebellion which, before the rendering of Nicaraguan assistance, was ill-organised, ill-equipped and ineffective. The delictual acts of the Nicaraguan Government have not been confined to provision of very large quantities of arms, munitions and supplies; Nicaragua (and Cuba) have joined with the Salvadoran rebels in the organisation, planning and training for their acts of insurgency; and Nicaragua has provided the Salvadoran insurgents with command-and-control facilities, bases, communications and sanctuary, which have enabled the leadership of the Salvadoran insurgency to operate from Nicaraguan territory. Under both customary and conventional international law, that scale of Nicaraguan subserve activity not only constitutes unlawful intervention in the affairs of El Salvador; it is cumulatively tantamount to an armed attack upon El Salvador."

  "Not only is El Salvador entitled to defend itself against this armed attack; it can, and has, called upon the United States to assist it in the exercise of collective self-defense. The United States is legally entitled to respond.  It can lawfully respond to Nicaragua's covert attempt to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by overt or covert pressures, military and other, upon the Government of Nicaragua, which are exerted either directly upon the Government, territory and people of Nicaragua by the United States, or indirectly through the actions of Nicaraguan rebels - the "contras" - supported by the United States."
  A [thorough investigation](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/2702452-Iran-Contra-Minority-Report) over the actual Iran/Contra should be a read for anyone interested in the case.
  As for the "guerilla manual" is largely overstated by pundits. After press reporting, [several investigations](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/statement-principal-deputy-press-secretary-speakes-central-intelligence-agency) followed: One by CIA's Independent Inspestor General; one by the President's Intelligence Oversight Board and lastly a [Congressional investigation](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/5/items/united-states-congressional-serial-set/United_States_Congressional_Serial_Set.pdf). All concluded the purpose of the manual was to aid moderate gurilla's against a brutal regime, and how to win support of the people. However, due to poor translation by the contractor who made the report, was misinterpreted. 
  
- It was alleged that the CIA, in El Salvador and Nicaragua supported death squads. This has been a [throroughly debunked](https://archive.org/details/united-states-congressional-serial-set) USSR hoax, to cover their support for such groups through Nicaraguan regime. 
 
   "The staff's investigation looked at press reports and materials from private organizations alleging a range of US intelligence activities with reference to death squads. These allegations can be summarized as follows:
  - That US intelligence trained, organized, financed and advised Salvadoran security forces that engaged in death squad activities;
  - That US intelligence was aware of torture and killing by Salvadoran security services and death squads, and in some cases participated in such killings.
  
   The Committee staff conducted a comprehensive review aimed at providing as much information as couble be gathered bearing on these allegations. It reviewed intelligence reporting on death squads as well as the intelligence tasking which established priorities for intelligence collection. The Staff examined all intelligence reporting bearing on death squads from 1979 to present. It reviewed State Department cables bearing on the same subject. The staff conducted interviews with numerious intelligence officials knowledgable about intelligence activities in El Salvador from 1979 to 1984. The staff also reviewed in detail a CIA Inspector General report requested by the Committee in connection with H. Res.467. This report reviewed CIA operational relationships that might have involved members of death dquads. Finally, the staff made additional requests for information. The staff review of operational intelligence relationships leads it to conclude that US intelligence agencies have not conducted any of their activities in such a way as to directly encourage or support death squad activities. To the contrary, US intelligence activities have been directed, sometimes successfully, at countering death squad activity, reducing thee power of individuals connected with death squads, and seeking their removal from positions of authority.
  
  The staff has uncovered no evidence that US intelligence oficials or US intelligence policy in any way encouraged torture by Salvadoran security service or by any death squads. To the Contrary, all that the staff can discover indicates US intelligence efforts to moderate the behavior of Salvadoran security service and armed forces personnel to prevent such activities. Further, as the US has learned more about death squad activity, and as it has concenreated more policy attention on this subject, some improvements have taken place. The staff poins in this regard to the exile from El Salvador of certain officials identified by the United States as having death Squad connections."
  
- 20 December, 1989, Operation Just Cause was launched. United States lawfully invaded the Republic of Panama to overthrow the dictatorship of General Manuel Antonio Noriega. By capturing the general, defeating the military forces he commanded, and [installing a democratic government](https://history.army.mil/html/books/just_cause/CMH_55-1-1_Just_%20Cause_opt.pdf)  in  the  country. There are many authoritative [studies](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Just_Cause.pdf) on Operation Just Cause. One that should be noted is [In the Aftermath of War: US support for reconstruction & nation-building in Panama following Just Cause](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Apr/05/2001727349/-1/-1/0/B_0061_SHULTZ_AFTERMATH_WAR.PDF)

- On October 1983, the United States [legally intervened](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Military_Law_Review/pdf-files/277865%7E1.pdf) in Grenada, with international partners, with [Minimal civilian casualties](https://web.archive.org/web/20170129131916/http://insidethecoldwar.org/sites/default/files/documents/Grenada%20A%20Preliminary%20Report%20December%2016%2C%201983.pdf), "Grenadian casualties were 45 killed and 337 wounded. 24 of the Grenadian dead were civilians, 21 of whom were killed in an unfortunate bombing of a mental hospital located adjacent to an anti-aircraft installation. 24 Cubans were killed and 59 wounded of the approximately 800 Cuban 'construction workers' on the island... By December 15, all U.S. combat forces had withdrawn; among the U.S. forces only training, police, medical and support elements remained."

- In 1981, Soviet propaganda outlet TASS, alleged that the United States was behind the death of Panamarian President Omar Torrijos. This was [confirmed](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00049R001303150031-0.pdf) to be be Soviet disinformation.

- During the 1980s, allegations from the Bailtimore Sun, reported in 1995, allegations of CIA's complicity in Honduran human rights abuses. This triggered then-DCI John M. Deutch to direct a review of the allegations, from the 1980s to 1995, the review, known as the Honduras Working Group concluded, "there is no information in CIA files indicating that CIA officers either authorized or were directly involved in human rights abuses." Some issues remained unresolved, and reported this to CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin. In July 1996, she requested the Inspector General investigate these outstanding matters. The IG report corroborated the Working Group's findings, "No evidence has been found to substantiate the allegation that any CIA employee was present during sessions of hostile interrogation or torture in Honduras." It also found no connection to the CIA in connection to, or evidence of the existance to ELACH, an alleged right-wing paramilitary organization; nor involved in any attempts to cover-up or downplay reporting. These two reviews independently corroborated a 1988 IG investigation that found no CIA aid or connection to any human righs abuses.. An OGC review also confirmed CIA had no involvement in, planned, or therwise connected to Olancho Operation. CIA policy regarding interrogations, and human rights in general is best described in a Janurary 14, 1985 HQ cable:
  >"...Intervewing and interrogation of suspect in custody is a method routinely used by police, security and intelligence services around the world. In many countries, legal and basic rights of the suspect in custody may not be given full consideration, resulting in deprivaction of his/her human rights. CIA policy is not to participate directly in nor to encourage interrigation that results in the use of force, mental or physical torture, extremely demeaning indignities or exposure to inhumane treatment of any kind, as an aid to interrogation. CIA policy is to actively discourage the use of these methods during interrogations. CIA should play a positive role in influencing foreign liasion to respect human rights." Participation includes being in the room during an interrogation, sitting in an adjoining room monitoring the interrogation or providing questions while an interrogation is in progress. 

  A March 1976 HQ cable described CIA's Human Righs Policies and guidance,
  >"...employees mus be especially sensitive to the political and possible legal remifications of what the CIA does. This cable also included a description of CIA officer's responsibilities if it were to be discovered that a host or third country intelligence or security service was about to undertake actions that could reasonably be construed to be gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. CIA personnel  also were advised in this cable that, as a general rule, they should make appropriate efforts to prevent or delay such actions..."

- From 1963-1973, CIA was involved in Chile politics. Though, not as broad as people claim. CIA aided in propaganda to help elect Frei. Frei lost the following election. CIA thought to reach out to some in the military for resistance before Allende could have his power confirmed by Congress. This went nowhere. CIA had 0 involvement in the coup itself. CIA had no involvement in Pinochet's claim to power. [An overview of CIA's activities confirms the following](https://web.archive.org/web/20040409084054/http://www.foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp):
  - Many of Pinochet's officers were involved in systematic and widespread human rights abuses following Allende's ouster. Some of these  were contacts or agents of the CIA or US Military. the IC followed then-current guidance for reporting such abuses and admonished its Chilean agents against such behavior. Today's much stricter reporting standards were not in force and, if they were, we suspect many agents would have been dropped.
  - During a period between 1974 and 1977, CIA maintained contact with Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who later became notorious for his involvement in human rights abuses. The US Government policy community approved CIA's contacts with Contreras, given his position as chief of the primary intelligence orginization in Chile, as necessary to accomplish the CIA's mission, in spite of conerns that this relationship might lay the CIA open to charges of aiding internal political repression. From the start, the CIA made it clear to Contreras was that it would not support any of his activities or activities of his service which might be construde as "internal political repression." In its contacts with Contreras, the CIA urged him to adere to a 17 Janurary 1974 circular, issued by the Chilean Ministry of Defense, spelling out guidelines for handling prisoners in a manner consistent with the 1949 Geneva Convention.
 
  - In May and June 1975, elements within the CIA recommended establishing a paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his unique position and access to Pinochet. This proposal was overruled, citing the US Government policy on clandestine relations with the head of an intelligence service notorious for human rights abuses. However, given the miscommunisations in the timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras.
A review of CIA's files has uncovered no evidence that CIA officers and employees were engaged in human rights abuses or in covering up any human rights abuses in Chile."

- The US Government also had no involvement in Operation Condor. The US also tried to [prevent & disrupt](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/5817664/National-Security-Archive-Doc-03-CIA-memorandum.pdf) the illegal activities and distance itself. The US asked Contreras to confirm its existance. [He did](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB416/docs/780822cia.pdf).

- In the 1970s the United States took a large effort to promote Human Rights via humanitarian aid, military assistance, intelligence cooperation, international institutions, etc. Carter's administration set up NSC 28 to coordinate US Human Rights [policy](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91M00696R000100030020-1.pdf), assess [impacts](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01362A000200100001-6.pdf) and to detail [efforts](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/RESPONSE%20TO%20PD-30%5B15516322%5D.pdf) to promote Human Rights. In 1977, Human Rights reporting became a main focus on US Intelligence reporting requirements, with positive customer feedback in formulating US foreign policy.[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83M00171R001200180001-5.pdf)
   
- CIA had [no involvement](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf) in dictator, Rafael Trujillo's assassination. Some Latin American countries thought the US had allowed his brutal regime, however, it was just US policy to refrain from actions that would hasten his downfall. The US did enourage moderate democractic groups to resist the regime. The policy of non-intervention, while required by treaty, convinced Latin Americans that the US was supportive. 

- In Bolivia, 1971, CIA made a one-time payment to [discourage](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve10/d76a) a reportedly imminent coup and to “cement relations” with Bolivian military figures. Unknown to the CIA, a coup would follow two days later.

- US President Johnson took office in 1963, he inherented a longstanding U.S. Government policy of providing financial support for Bolivian political leaders. The policy was intended to promote stability in Bolivia by strengthening moderate forces, especially within the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) itself, which had a strong left wing under the leadership of Juan Lechin Oquendo, General Secretary of the Mine Workers’ Federation. In August 1963 the 5412 Special Group approved a covert subsidy to assist the MNR to prepare for the presidential elections scheduled for May 1964. The Special Group agreed in March 1964 that the MNR receive additional financial support. Paz won the election; Lechin (who had been Vice President under Paz) left the government and founded a rival leftist party. Covert action expenditures in Bolivia between fiscal year 1963 and fiscal year 1965 were as follows: FY 63—$337,063; FY 64—$545,342; and FY 65—$287,978. The figure for FY 65 included funds to influence the campesino movement, for propaganda, to support labor organizations, and to support youth and student groups. The FY 66 program also allocated funds to support moderate political groups and individuals backing General Barrientos for President.

  On November 4, 1964, the new Vice President, General René Barrientos Ortuño (MNR), led a successful military coup d’etat, forcing Paz into exile, (No US involvement in coup). In February 1965 the 303 Committee authorized a financial subsidy to the MNR under Barrientos (who was aware of U.S. financial support to the MNR) to help establish an organizational base for the presidential election scheduled for September. In May 1965 Barrientos responded to growing labor unrest by arresting and deporting Lechin and postponing the election. The 303 Committee, which considered a recommendation to support Barrientos as the best available candidate, agreed in July 1965 and March 1966 to authorize additional funds for MNR propaganda and political action in support of the ruling Junta’s plans to pacify the country and hold elections to establish a civilian, constitutional government.

  When the presidential election was finally held in July 1966, Barrientos won easily, and officials concerned with the covert operation concluded that the objectives of the program—the _end of military rule_ and a _civilian, constitutional government_ whose _policies would be compatible with those of the United States—had been accomplished._ [1](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d147)
  
 - In 1962, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the DoD approved a draft plan, known as Operation [Northwoods](https://ia600908.us.archive.org/7/items/pdfy-vlGx2NTBHA-M19I3/Operation%20NORTHWOODS%20Document%20-%20Official%20Origin%20of%20Modern%20US%20False-Flag%20Attacks.pdf), which authorised:
   - Start rumors 
   - Land friendly Cubans in uniform "over the fence" to stage attack on base
   - Capture (friendly) saboteurs inside base
   - Start riots near base (friendly Cubans)
   - Blow up ammunition inside the base; start fired.
   - Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals for mock-victims.
    It goes on to say, "we could blow up a drone (unmanned) vessel anywhere in the Cuban waters."
     The media has incorrect claimed that the plans were intended to cause harm to civilians.

- In 1954, Guatemala saw a military Junta, led by Carlos Castillo Armas, in a coup against the Árbenz government. It has been alleged the CIA had a role in this coup. The reason for this being a popularly held belief is that declassified CIA records do indeed outline CIA plans for such an activity, such as training exiles, assassination lists, etc. These are known as PBFORTUNE and PBSUCCESS. However: This [never came to fruition](https://web.archive.org/web/20180609064148/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000135796.pdf). No Árbenz official or Guatemalan Communist were killed—due to US plans being dropped. 
 
### Africa

- On July 20, 2021, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia, conducted one airstrike in the vicinity of Galkayo, Somalia, against al-Shabaab fighters engaged in active combat against Somali Government forces. Initial assessment confirms [0 civilians killed](https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/33893/us-africa-command-conducts-strike-against-al-shabaab).


- In March 2019, Amnesty International issued a report about US Airstrikes in Somalia, alleging US ignores CIVCAS claims, commits war crimes, etc. 
Several [experts](https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2019/03/31/why-you-should-be-very-skeptical-of-amnesty-internationals-report/) have gone over the inferior methodology employed by NGOs like Amnesty on such matters. However, an [independent review](https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/31697/u-s-africa-command-commander-directed-review-reveals-civilian-casualties) conducted confirms Amnesty got it wrong—again. This isn't the first time. The NGO, (and others have been shown to not even get the [month correct](https://archive.org/details/africomcivcas/mode/2up), when alleging a US airstrike.

- Since 2007, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), has done a number of assistance programs to African countries, ranging from [humanitarian aid, civil assistance](https://www.africom.mil/what-we-do), etc.
  Some of these are:
   - >Foreign Disaster Relief: Foreign Disaster Relief activities are unique Department of Defense capabilities (normally airlift or logistics) supporting USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) specific requests as approve by the U.S. Secretary of Defense. AFRICOM has responded to two disasters in the last decade (Ebola in West Africa in 2014, and Tropical Storm Idia in Mozambique in 2018), while BHA responds to dozens annually. The international community and BHA are normally able to respond to most disasters without DoD support. It is only the sudden onset catastrophic disasters overwhelming international community that require DoD support.
   - >Humanitarian and Civic Assistance: Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) activities are conducted in conjunction with authorized operations and exercises of the military services in a foreign country, with the approval of the partner nation national and local civilian authorities, and complement - not duplicate - other forms of humanitarian assistance provided to the partner nation by the Department of State and USAID. Funded by AFRICOM, these activities also serve the basic economic and social needs of the partner nation and promote the security and foreign policy interests of the U.S., the security interests of the country in which the activities are to be performed, and the specific operational readiness skills of the service members who participate in the HCA activities.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Disaster Preparedness Program: The Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP) increases the capacity of African nations to mitigate and prepare for an all-hazard disaster response within the ministry designated to respond. The program supports civilian-military interface, and enhancing collaboration and the military’s ability to perform their civil support functions. It also improves the capacity for regional interaction and stability in the event of a complex emergency such as a pandemic event. Working with national and regional entities in a comprehensive, holistic manner, the program builds capacity and capability over time. Funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), the DPP may provide training, planning support, technical assistance, exercise validation, and equipment purchases.
   - >Humanitarian Mine Action: The Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) program relieves human suffering and the adverse effects of land mines and other explosive remnants of war on noncombatants - including ammunition stockpiles - while advancing theater campaign plan strategies and U.S. national security objectives. The Department of Defense supports foreign governments in detection, clearance, physical security, and stockpile management of landmines and other explosive remnants of war by executing cadre development programs designed to develop capabilities for a wide range of HMA activities including education, training, and technical assistance.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Other: U.S. Africa Command’s Humanitarian Assistance - Other (HA-O) program includes activities designed to relieve or reduce endemic conditions such as human suffering, disease, hunger, and privation, particularly in regions where humanitarian needs may pose major challenges to stability, prosperity, and respect for universal human values. These program activities are funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), and address basic healthcare, education, and infrastructure needs. Common projects include construction of health clinics, schools, and provision of humanitarian supplies, and are intended to reduce the risk of, prepare for, mitigate the consequences of, or respond to humanitarian disasters.
   - >Pandemic Response Program: Since 2008 U.S. Africa Command has worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development to establish a Pandemic Response Program (PRP) aimed at assisting African militaries develop influenza pandemic response plans that are integrated into their country’s overall national response plans. Militaries can play key roles in the event of a pandemic, working in collaboration with other governmental, non-governmental and international organizations to maintain security, provide logistical support for food, medicine and other commodities, maintain communications, and provide augmented medical care. PRP strives to improve the capacity for regional stability in the event of a complex emergency by providing training and technical assistance, and identifies - and at times purchases - limited equipment needed for selected countries.
   - >Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP): The Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program is the DoD initiative in support of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that aims to support healthy and functional military forces to provide stability and safety to national and regional populations. Africa’s high rates of HIV/AIDS negatively impact African militaries and other uniformed organizations by reducing readiness, limiting peacekeeping deployments, and increasing risk to military and civilian personnel. DHAPP provides military-to-military program support by assisting in the development and implementation of culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment programs. AFRICOM provides oversight and strategic guidance so that DHAPP can develop and implement a culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment program. At over $100 million annually and operating in 38 countries, DHAPP is AFRICOM’s largest program on the Continent.
Current strategies and interventions employed by DHAPP include: Index case HIV testing (testing spouses, sexual partners, and all children of women who test HIV-positive); Documentation of every new HIV-positive individual and linking him or her into care and treatment; Periodically updating military HIV policies to address HIV testing strategies, chain of command notifications, deployments, stigma and discrimination, and antiretroviral treatment initiation and retention to reflect changes in international normative guidance; Antiretroviral treatment services thru mobile units; Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills building, and facilitated access to condoms; Promotion of voluntary medical male circumcision services which can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection in HIV-negative men by 60%; and stigma and discrimination prevention training.

- The US Department of Defense offers legal education to any nation who requests, through the [Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEpHRVqEgs4). A highly effective program that tailors to the specific host country. Members of the a foreign Military may visit the US, in Resident programs, or, the US may conduct workshops within the Country. These cover a [wide-varity](https://globalnetplatform.org/system/files/diils_2020_catalog_no_contacts.pdf) of legal issues: Human rights law, military justice, equal rights, etc. It has seen [major success](https://youtu.be/zEpHRVqEgs4?t=497), over a decade, DILLS worked with a number of African nations on justice reform, and methods to investigate and prosecute military personnel for sexual violent and gender-based crimes within the military. This sustained effort saw a sharp decline in sexual assault cases, an increase in successful investigations and prosecutions. These offer the ability to increase civilian oversight of the military, to either enhance, or develop their legal framework.

### Europe

- It has been alleged that Abu Omar subject to a CIA rendition in Italy in 2003. There has been 0 evidence to confirm the allegation. However, even if it were true, the rendition is perfectly legal under international law. Indeed, the Italian judicial system [violated international law](https://harvardnsj.org/2010/11/all-human-rights-are-equal-but-some-are-more-equal-than-others-the-extraordinary-rendition-of-a-terror-suspect-in-italy-the-nato-sofa-and-human-rights/), in respect to human rights.

- In 1999, the United States & NATO engaged in major [military operation](https://www.airforcemag.com/PDF/DocumentFile/Documents/2005/Kosovo_013100.pdf) for 78 days—to end the atrocities committed by the Serbian regime in Kosovo. The major goals were:
  - Ensuring the stability of Eastern Europe. Serb aggression in Kosovo directly threatened peace throughout the Balkans and thereby the stability of all of southern Europe. There was no natural boundary to this violence, which had already moved through Slovenia and Croatia to Bosnia.
  - Thwarting ethnic cleasning. The Belgrade regime's cruel repressio in Kosovo, driving thousands from their homes, created a humanitarian crisis of staggering proportions. Milosevic's campaign, which he dubbed "Operation Horseshoe", would have led to even more homeless, starvation, and loss of life had his ruthlessness gone unchecked.
  - Ensuring NATO's credability. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia signed agreements in October 1998 that were to be verified by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and monitored by NATO. in the period leading up to March 1999, Serbian forces increasingly and flagrantly violated these agreements. Had NATO not responded to Milosevic's defiance and his campaign of ethnic cleansing, its credability would have have been called into question.
   
  The US/NATO campaign, Operation Allied Force—was in [full compliance with international law](https://archive.org/details/legalethicalless78wall/mode/2up).
   Indeed, the International Tribunal has ruled all aspects of the campaign were [lawful](https://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal#IVB4). 
   
- In 1995, NATO launched [Operation Deliberate Force](https://www.airforcemag.com/article/1097deliberate/). The air campaign resulted in few civilian casualties, and ended the civil conflict. Indeed, experts [have documented](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0074_OWEN_DELIBERATE_FORCE.pdf) the Operation's efforts to avoid civilian casualties and applaud its efforts and results, "constraints on force application  entailed  avoidingcollateral effects and unintended consequences that would becounterproductive to the political peace process. This effort toavoid collateral and unintended damage extended not only to the surrounding  physical targets but also to concerns aboutfratricide, refugees, and noncombatant civilian casualties.2 Theneed for precision offensive air operations (OAS) platforms andweapons to limit  collateral damage while accomplishinh mission objectives became  an overriding concern during the Balkans air campaign. Thus, precision-guided munitions (PGM) became the overwhelming weapons of choice during air  strike operations. Indeed, Deliberate Force became the first air campaign in history to employ more precision-guided bombs andmissiles than unguided ones."

- It has been alleged that the CIA supported right-wing terror groups in Italy from the 50s to the 90s, under "Operation Gladio". This has been a long-debunked, [Soviet propaganda piece](https://www.scribd.com/document/114855262/Misinformation-About-Gladio-Stay-Behind-Networks-Resurfaces).

- The list claims the CIA installed Georgious Papadopoulos in a Greece military coup in 1967. The list cited a wiki entry that contradicts the allegation, and confirms it was just that: An allegation. The wiki entry states, "during William Colby's confirmation hearing to be Director of Central Intelligence, Colby was asked by Stuart Symington, chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, if there was any justification for the assertions. Colby [replied](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074749253&view=2up&seq=7) that he had the allegations researched and found that the CIA had not engineered the coup, Papadopoulos was not an agent of the CIA, and that Papadopoulos was never paid by the CIA."

- It has been alleged that the CIA, from 1948 onwards, had an operation called, "mockingbird" as an operation to manipulate media domestically and abroad. This is a hoax. As confirmed in the CIA's '[Family Jewels](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101104822/https://www.cia.gov/open/Family%20Jewels.pdf)', all Mockingbird was, was a wiretap on two journalists for a few months as they were suspected of making public some classified information. "During the period from 12 March 1963 to 15 June 1963, this office installed telephone taps on two Washington-based newsmen who were suspected of disclosing classified information..."

It has been confirmed by the CIA, DOJ and DoD that there was no operation to rescue criminals from prosecution. Indeed the opposite is true, these bodies worked hard to bring justice to many of these criminals. The CIA, [more than any](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf), aided in bringing such justice in aiding the DOJ's Office of Special Investigations.

- During and after WW2, US and allied forces investigated allegations against their own forces. Rape, murder, detainee abuse, etc. Against civiians and German soldier.

However, due to unforeseen issues such as the overwhelming numbers of German troop surrender, far more than planned—the Allied forces struggled to maintain sanitation conditions and other needs. They did improve overtime, but struggled. No Geneva violations occured.

### Asia

- The 1970s-80s position on Khmer Rouge is compliated, spanning several years. For this reason, I'll quote at length from a deep-dive [study](https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Todd_Buchwald_Report_031819.pdf) on how the US addresses genocides over several decades, and why it takes certain actions over others. At no point did the US acually support, covertly or otherwise, Khmer Rouge.
 
   "The Cambodia case is complicated. There is a widespread public understanding that the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge government during its 1975-1978 rule constituted genocide, but a large portion of its atrocities were directed against the “wrong” kinds of groups—political and social groups, as opposed to “national, ethnical, racial or religious” groups—to fit neatly into the definition of genocide in the 1948 Convention. Indeed, only over time did it become well-understood that some of the atrocities—such as those directed against the ethnic Vietnamese and Cham—fit within the Convention’s definition.
 
   State Department lawyers recognized early the potential gap between the abuses and the Genocide Convention, and they expressed doubts internally that, at least on the basis of the facts as then known, the Khmer Rouge atrocities constituted genocide.162 Nevertheless, in September 1978, they proactively sought to stir the British government’s interest in bringing a formal genocide case against Cambodia in the Inter-national Court of Justice, telling their UK colleagues that the negative publicity generated by an ICJ case could inhibit further atrocities.163 In the end, the British lawyers concluded the substance of the allegation was too doubtful and declined to move forward with an ICJ case.164 As the Carter administration faced pressure to make clear how its human rights policy applied to this gravest of cases, its rhetorical condem-nation of the Khmer Rouge came to include, on a handful of occasions, statements that at least obliquely characterized Khmer Rouge abuses as genocide.165

  Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia in December 1978 changed the geopolitical context. The Khmer Rouge were ousted and a government aligned with the Soviet Union was installed at a time when US ties with Moscow were fraught and relations with China were stronger. This shift in power created strong incen-tives for the United States to tamp down its rhetoric regarding the Khmer Rouge, as part of a broader decision by the United States to support the Cambodian opposition—which included the Khmer Rouge—in opposing Vietnam’s invasion as unlawful aggression. This extended to supporting the seating of Pol Pot’s ousted regime to continue representing Cambodia in the United Nations.166 Fearful of reinforcing Vietnam’s argument that the Khmer Rouge’s crimes had justified its invasion, Carter administration officials appear to have ceased alluding to the ex-regime’s atrocities as genocide from early 1979, and in a number of instances instead used the term to describe the conduct of the Vietnam-backed successor government.167 Reagan Administration officials did use genocide language regarding the Khmer Rouge from time to time thereafter, though usually in the context of general statements about atrocities or Communist rule, rather than statements focused on Cambodia.168 Through all this, however, the State Department’s Office of the Legal Adviser had never formally concluded that the Khmer Rouge atrocities in fact fell within the definition of genocide.169

  The US government ultimately confronted the issue in a more systematic way in connection with the Cambodian peace talks that began with a multinational conference held in Paris in 1989, and continued in New York, Beijing, Jakarta, and elsewhere. In preparing for those peace talks and the negotiations of arrangements for power sharing in a potential transitional government, the US participants anticipated that the Vietnamese and their Cambodian allies would take every opportunity to justify the invasion—and the exclusion of the Khmer Rouge from a future government—by claiming that the invasion had saved Cambodia from “genocide” while, for their part, the Cambodian opposition would insist on character-izing the main issue as Vietnamese “settlers”—those who had come to Cambodia after the invasion and symbolized Vietnamese hegemony over the country. The twin issues of “genocide” and “settlers” perme-ated much of the 1989 conference and, predictably, the two sides were unable to agree on mention of the words.170 For its part, the United States saw no advantage in intervening in the debate and avoided stating a formal view on whether the atrocities constituted genocide.171

  After the 1989 conference ended without an agreement, key members of Congress sharply criticized the administration’s approach. They had expressed concern as early as 1979 that the Khmer Rouge were likely to fight their way back into power if Vietnam withdrew its forces from Cambodia without appro-priate arrangements in place to exclude them.172 As Vietnamese withdrawal now loomed, they expressed alarm that the US government was not taking a sufficiently hardline posture in ensuring arrangements that would prevent the Khmer Rouge from regaining power. At a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee hearing in September 1989, Chairman Stephen Solarz and Congressman Chester Atkins raised partic-ular concerns that the United States in Paris had not supported draft language that the Khmer Rouge was responsible for genocide—the deletion of which Atkins, at least, saw as giving the group legitimacy and facilitating its entry into a transitional government.173 They pressed Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Richard Solomon to say at the hearing whether “what happened in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979 can appropriately be characterized as genocide.” Solomon declined to provide a direct answer, saying that the legal definition was complex and that in any event there were practical concerns that using the word would bolster the Vietnamese negotiating position in the talks. Solomon’s unwillingness to use the word “genocide” appeared to fuel the Congressmen’s concerns about the US government’s posture toward the Khmer Rouge’s participation in a new government.174

  At a hearing two months later where Solomon’s deputy and the department’s deputy legal adviser testi-fied, Solarz and Atkins pressed the point again, as it had been anticipated they would. US officials had discussed how to answer these questions after the September hearing, though different participants have different recollections of the decision-making process. Unlike the later cases in Bosnia and Rwanda, it appears that no formal memorandum was prepared for approval by the secretary of state.175 In any event, the deputy legal adviser, Michael Young, testified that the Khmer Rouge had committed genocide, but said that he wanted to qualify his answer to make clear that the term “genocide” “seemed some-what under-inclusive for what [the Khmer Rouge] actually did.”176 Apparently perceiving even Young’s remarks as evasive, an annoyed Congressman Atkins cut off the explanation, saying that he had had enough of “namby-pamby sensitivities.”177

  The resistance to what Congressman Atkins viewed as parsing of the words by the administration witness was in some ways a harbinger of what we will see in later situations in which advocates became impa-tient with anything they perceived as equivocation. In any event, the State Department provided a formal written answer after the hearing that made clear the point that the deputy legal adviser had wanted to make—i.e., that it was only the attacks against particular groups that constituted genocide. His answer stated —
  >The Convention’s definition of genocide does not, however, address the full extent of atroci-ties committed by members of the Khmer Rouge. Mass murder not intended to destroy any of [the groups mentioned] is not genocide under the Convention, regardless of the numbers killed. Because much of the Khmer Rouge slaughter was random, politically motivated, or the result of harsh conditions imposed on society at large, many acts would probably not constitute genocide as defined in the Convention. 
 
- In the 1975 Australian Constitutional Crisis, CIA nor Royal Crown had any involvement in the dismisal. All historians and investigations confirm this is an unsupported [conspiracy theory](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/arthur-tange-the-cia-and-the-dismissal/).

- During the Vietnam war, the US deployed herbicides to allow better troop movement in the jungle. This was known as Operation Ranch Hand.
Unknown to the US, one of its agents, agent orange, was toxic. Agent Orange was actually safe, however, a contamination issue occurred during the manufacture of 2,4,5,T. This was what was toxic: 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). [Contamination](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780306422478) was between less than [0.05 to almost 50 parts per million, with a mean of about 2 parts per million](https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/items/show/1318). Allegations that it was used to harm/kill combatants or civilians is [false](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/98481.pdf). The US did deploy one of its agents [_briefly_ to target _few, select_ crops belonging to the viet cong](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/28/2001329797/-1/-1/0/AFD-100928-054.pdf). The Americans were very relectent to do this, however, South Vietnam insisted its use. The US only accepted under very strict controls & criteria, and if the South Government would gurantee humanitarian supplies should it be needed.

- In July 1972, the Hanoi propaganda effort ramped up, claiming the US deliberately attacked several Dikes, causing civilian casualties. However, an [independent, internal review](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T00875R001700040062-8.pdf) confirmed this not to be the case. "A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital dike system. A few dikes have been hit, apparently by stray bombs directed at military-associated targets nearby. The observable damage is minor and no major dike has been breached."

- Operation Linebacker 1, from May 9 to October 23, 1972 and Operation Linebacker 2, from December 18 to December 29, 1972 were bombing campaigns against North Vietnam. North Vietnam illegally invaded South Vietnam, which triggered Operation Linebacker 1, targeting their military supply lines, etc. This was a successful effort in forcing the North to the peace table. However, the North Vietnam Government stalled peace talks, while trying to secretly build their forces. This prompted the Nixon Admin to begin Linebacker 2. A shorter campaign that while effective, was surrounded by disinformation alleging "indiscriminate targeting of civilians". An [independent assessment](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA191278/page/n1/mode/2up) concludes, "that the Linebacker campaigns were militarily effective and that, had AFP 110-31 been in effect in 1972, the campaigns, as they were actually conducted, would have conformed to the pamphlet's restrictions on aerial bombardment. These campaigns demonstrate that the pamphlet's rules on aerial bombardment are practical and can be complied with, given the proper technology and a conscious effortby commanders, their staffs, and aircrews."
 
   A [scholarly paper](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/1983_Vol34_No1-6/1983_Vol34_No2.pdf) from W. Hays Park, a world-leading LOAC expert, also confirms these operations were in compliance with international law, and details the efforts to mitigate collateral damage and civilian casualties. He concludes, "Both Linebacker campaigns were also conducted with anacute awareness by the military of its responsibilities under the law of war, with mission parameters well within the prohibitions of the law. Although unprecedented in the degree of precaution taken by an attacker to minimize collateral injury to the civilian population of an enemy, each campaign was successful  inattaining its objectives." 
   
- In the early 1970s, allegations of CIA's complicity in illegal drug trafficking in Laos. One such popular purpetrator of this lie was Alfred W. McCoy's 'The politics of heroin in Southeast Asia'. However, this book, and media claims of this were far from the facts of reality. CIA Headquaters and Stations in Asia actively pressured the resistance groups they aided from engaging in such activities, such as driving the Yao chieftain Chao out of the buisiness; the Agency also made sure no US assets would be used for illegal smuggling. CIA's sensitivities to the illegal activity was so great, that one "acting chief of security once proposed a sting operation, with narcotics on an Air America plane going to Saigon used to lure traffickers there into a trap. Devlin imagined the press hysteria that would result if word got out about drugs moving on the CIA's airline, and he rejected the idea on the spot." Other details of CIA efforts to counter the narcotics smuggling can be found in the declassified book, '[Undercover Armies, CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf)'

- In 1970, in Cambodia, the CIA had no involvement in Prince Sihanouk's coup. The list's own wiki citation even admits there is no evidence. 

- In 1965, the United States with South Vietnam the air campaign under the [Rolling Thunder program](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T02095R000900070018-0.pdf). This program resulted in [effective military gains](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00472A000800020017-1.pdf), while producing very few civilian casualties: Between [3,900 and 5,400](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T02095R000900070009-0.pdf) and [34,000, of which 21,000 were killed](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78S02149R000200020003-4.pdf) by then-standards. The second study reviews all propaganda claims made by the North Vietnam regime and concludes most of them false and inaccurate. The purpose of the program was to impede the North regime's supply of weapons and men to aid insurgent groups in the South, and in the long-term make continued physical support to insurgents too costly for North Vietnam.
Another detailed overview of the program can be found [here](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80T01629R000300080014-9.pdf) From target selection to casualty estimates, to goals, etc. A [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20161106133619/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/parks.html) by one of the world's leading law of war experts, concludes that it complied with, and far exceeded international law,"Rolling Thunder was one of the most constrained military campaigns in history. The restrictions imposed by this nation’s civilian leaders were not based on the law of war but on an obvious ignorance of the law —to the detriment of those sent forth to battle."

- Many pundits and historical revisionists allege the US was behind the 1965 coup in Indonesia. The 30 September Movement. This couldn't be furthest from the truth. In the declassified publication, _[The lessons of the September 30 affair](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017175932/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol14no2/pdf/v14i2a02p.pdf)_ a fantastic summary of events is detailed, however a brief mention to the largest, comprehensive and authoritative study is summized, "In her study _[The Coup that backfired](https://web.archive.org/web/20171208040813/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-40.pdf)_, Ms Helen Hunter went a long way toward dispelling the myth of the Chinese Communist involvement in the purge attempt. She concluded that while Peking had probable learned of the Sukarno/PKI plan, as indeed it must have through agent penetration of the Palace and the PKI, the Chinese did not instigate the plot or particupate in carrying it out. The same conclision is implicit in an earlier article in _studies in Intelligence_ in _[The Steptember 30 Movement](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123064222/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010008-4.pdf)_ by John T. Pizzicaro.
Like us, the Chinese knew something important was imminent. But I doubt whether they could truly have comprehended the nature of the plot and its implications."
CIA had [no involvement](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf) in the assassination is also confirmed by the declassiied Rockefeller commission.

- The Vietnam war and the US' entire air campaign; counter to many historical revisionists, was actually hampered by strict Rules of Engagement that often left the Military allowing the Vietcong to remain safe, even though they're far clear of any surrounding civilian populations. In another [scholarly paper](https://www.loc.gov/law/mlr/Military_Law_Review/27687D~1.pdf) by a world-leading legal expert and practitioner, it was found while studying Air Force ROEs, "the policy of gradualism, implemented by the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1968, resulted in ROE of unprecedented detail and restrictiveness." Indeed, an [internal air force study](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA597620/page/n1/mode/2up) prior concluded the same, "military barracks were prohibited. The suppression of SAMS and gun-laying radar systems was prohibited in this area as were attacks on NVN air bases from which attacking aircraft might be operating."

- In 1950, it was alleged that A US airstrike deliberately targeted South Korean refugees in the village of Nogeun-ri.
An [independent and authoritative investigation](https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/armymil/www.army.mil/nogunri/default.htm) summarised as follows:
"Over the last year, the Review Team has conducted an exhaustive factual review by examining over a million documents from the National Archives, conducting interviews with approximately 200 American witnesses, and analyzing the interview transcripts and oral statements of approximately 75 Korean witnesses.  The U.S. Review Team also closely examined press reports, aerial imagery, and other forensic examination results.  This U.S. Report reflects the U.S. Review Team’s factual findings based upon all the evidence available on the incident. During late July 1950, Korean civilians were caught between withdrawing U.S. forces and attacking enemy forces.  As a result of U.S. actions during the Korean War in the last week of July 1950, Korean civilians were killed and injured in the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  The Review Team did not find that the Korean deaths and injuries occurred exactly as described in the Korean account.  To appraise these events, it is necessary to recall the circumstances of the period.  U.S. forces on occupation duty in Japan, mostly without training for, or experience in, combat were suddenly ordered to join ROK forces in defending against a determined assault by well-armed and well-trained NKPA forces employing both conventional and guerilla warfare tactics.  The U.S. troops had to give up position after position.  In the week beginning July 25, 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division, withdrawing from Yongdong toward the Naktong River, passed through the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  Earlier, roads and trails in South Korea had been choked with civilians fleeing south.  Disguised NKPA soldiers had mingled with these refugees.  U.S. and ROK commanders had published a policy designed to limit the threat from NKPA infiltrators, to protect U.S. forces from attacks from the rear, and to prevent civilians from interfering with the flow of supplies and troops.  The ROK National Police were supposed to control and strictly limit the movements of innocent refugees.
In these circumstances, especially given the fact that many of the U.S. soldiers lacked combat-experienced officers and Non-commissioned officers, some soldiers may have fired out of fear in response to a perceived enemy threat without considering the possibility that they might be firing on Korean civilians." 

- In 1950s, The Soviet Union, China and North Korea started propaganda that the US had used Biological weapons against civilians and combatants. This has been a long-debunked conspiracy theory. Tactics used by China and NK include the establishment of [fake Scientific panels, presenting fabricated evidence](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/250/korean-war-biological-warfare-allegations). 
Other papers from [1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7783939/) and even recent [declassified documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425205433/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01731R003300190004-6.pdf) discussing analysis of the ISC report have flaws in logic, biology and [methodology](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/leitenberg_biological_weapons_korea.pdf) as well as intelligence reporting about the [deliberate lies](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20419558/bw-comint-baptism-files.pdf) from the USSR on the matter. This type of propaganda wasn't unique to USSR/NK/China allegations to the US. Other [countries also accused each other](https://web.archive.org/web/20190502135521/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-18electrv699.pdf) It's also worth noting that when the international community such as the ICRC and UN asked to do investigations, China, the Soviets and NK all declined.

- In 1968, My Lai was substantiated by the [Peers investigation](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RDAR-Vol-I.pdf). Those responsible were held to account. Since then, nothing like it has returned. However the list incorrectly states it was between 347-504 civivlians killed. It was 175.

- In 1967, the South Vietnamese government operated a program called Phung Hoang or Phoenix. CIA aided in it, but it was [not theirs](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000300130040-4.pdf). It has been calleged that it was an assassination/torture program—this is [not true](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R000800090012-8.pdf). Since independent actions against the CVI were deemed inefficient and ineffective, the Phung Hoang program was concieved to unite and coordinate a total government effort against the VCI. As such, Phung Hoand represented an intelligence coordination mechanism—in the form of coordinating committees at the province, regional and national level; and intelligence and operations coordinating centers at the province and district level—which aimed at a united total governmental effort against the CVI. It was _not_ a program of assassination or terror in response to Communist terror, and the program did not authorise torture, brutality or cruel methods in the interrogation or handling of captives. The US further worked with the Government to make sure [adequate, humane treatment as focal, observing fair concepts of due process and improve conditions of internment](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001100060018-1.pdf).

- In 1953, an insurgent pseudo-nationalist, the Pathet Lao, under the control of North Vietnam started an insurrection against the Royal Government of Laos. Their false propaganda has been [well documented](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R000600080007-0.pdf) and widely disregarded by academics and historians. The US, responding within the [framework of the Geneva Agreements](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001300050007-2.pdf), supplied military equipement and supplies for the Lao armed forces. This was within the provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol to the Declaration the Neutrality of Laos signed in Geneva in 1962. Because of the consistent refusal by the Pathet Lao to allow the ICC teams to enter their territory to inspect alleged violations of the Geneva agreement, the first American reconnaissance flight was flown over the southern part of Laos on 19 May 1964 after consultations with Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma the previous day. On 28 May 1964 Souvanna Phouma publically endorsd these recon missions over Laos stating that they were necessary to observe communist violations of the Accords.

- It has been alleged that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a US false flag to justify the Vietnam war, and that it's admitted in the declassified record. This is a well-debunked myth. The list cites a wiki entry, which cites to a declassified NSA document as evidence. However, problems arise when one actually reads the document in question. 1) It's an opinion piece in NSA's Cryptologic Quaterly. 2) The author in the study actually caustions against a conspiracy theory take, "This mishandling of SIGINT was not done in a manner that can be construde as conspiratorial , that is, with manufactured evidence and collusion at all levels. Rather, the objective of these individuals was to support the Navy's claim that the Desoto patrol had been deliberately attacked by the North Veitnamese." It's worth noting as well, that the NSA, while appreciative of the study, [disagrees](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/gulf-of-tonkin/articles/release-2/rel2_thoughts_intelligence.pdf) with the author's central premise: That SIGINT/COMINT was mishandled. According to the response, "This article does dispute Mr. Hanyok's assertion that SIGINT was mishandled, deliberately skewed or not provided to the Johnson administration. In fact, the record shows that NSA performed magnificently during this period of crisis, providing all SIGINT available in a timely manner to a broad spectrum of customers. With only a few trained Vietnamese linguists at NSA Headquarters and field stations analyzing encrypted North Vietnamese communications, NSA still provided U.S. forces advance warning of possible intended attacks that quite likely prevented the sinking of a U.S. destroyer on 2 August.

  Further evidence refuting the claim that COMINT information was presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964 can be found in the NSA review of Secretary McNamara's testimony before Congress. NSA noted that McNamara systematically used overkill language with COMINT and that the COMINT surrounding Tonkin was "flexible for interpretation". Again in 1972, as noted by Mr. Hanyok, NSA Deputy Director Dr. Tordella provided Senator Fulbright's staff director Carl Marcy access to all NSA material relating to the Gulf of Tonkin and told Mr. Marcy that the intercept of 4 August could indeed refer to events that occurred on 2 August.
  
  These facts make it clear that NSA consistently provided the Administration, as well as Congress, all COMINT information related to the events of 2-4 August. In fact, one NSA manager present during the August 1964 events has stated, "the folks downtown were provided all of the COM INT as they wanted to do their own analysis. They weren't overly interested in what we thought." Some would argue that NSA should have explicitly informed decision makers in formal SIGINT reporting that COMINT showed there was no attack on 4 August. However, the available COMINT could not support such a position. While some analysts did indeed come to such a conclusion, the COMINT itself, as noted by Dr. Tordella, was "flexible for interpretation".

  In the final analysis, it is clear that not only was SIGINT information _not_ presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964, but that all of the COM INT produced was distributed to CIA, JCS, DIA and other customers and that NSA uncertainties, even of single words, were made known to decision makers."
  
- In the summer of 1950 in South Korea, South Korea engaged in a massacre. British and US Governments tried to prevent it, and managed to save a large number of civilians. United States official documents show that John J. Muccio, then United States Ambassador to South Korea, made recommendations to South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo that the executions be stopped. Great Britain raised this issue with the U.S. at a diplomatic level, causing Dean Rusk, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, to inform the British that U.S. commanders were doing "everything they can to curb such atrocities".[8] During the massacre, the British protected their allies and saved some citizens.

- CIA has [no involvement](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2018/104-10214-10036.pdf) in the 1963 assassination/coup in Vietnam of President Diem.
  
- Several studies of US post-WW2 activities, policies and views have been made public, and offer the most detailed overview of 3 decades (50s-70s) in Asia:
  - _[US Intelligence and Vietnam](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123192047/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001433692.pdf)_ is an independent study designed to undertake a detailed examination of finished intelligence relating to the Vietnam conflict from the time of introduction of US combat forces in 1965 through the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975. In settling on the scope of the study, it was decided to go back to the beginning of the American involvement in Indochina toward the end of World War II and cover at least the major developments that occured during a period of approximately three decades. 1945-1975.
  - A compendium, _[Estimative Products on Vietnam: 1948-1975](https://chinhnghia.com/Vietnam_1948-1975_Book.pdf)_ provides a lengthy, detailed overview before the documents.
  - Thomas Ahern Jr.'s monograph, _[CIA and Rural Pacification in South Vietnam](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf)_ which details CIA's efforts to win the "hearts and minds" of the South Vietnamese rural population. It's a compelling account of CIA's contributions to the US effort  to establish and preserve an independent nation in South Vietnam. Despite local success, the CIA effort was, in the end, part of a major tragedy. No one, either in Washington or in the field, grasped the immense complexity and difficulty in instituting a massive effort to control the contryside, win the support of the peasantry, and promote political reforms, while fighting a determined and entrenched enemy.
  - _[Baptism by fire: CIA analysis of the Korean War](https://web.archive.org/web/20170911114643/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/international-relations/korean-war-baptism-by-fire/baptism-by-fire.pdf)_ Notes, among other things, that the Truman administration believed that the USSR orchestrated the Korean War.
  - History of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, _The Joint Chiefs of Staff and The War in Vietnam 1960–1968 [Part 1](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Vietnam/Vietnam_1960-1968_P001.pdf)_ & _[Part 2](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Vietnam/Vietnam_1960-1968_P002.pdf)_
  - _[CIA and the House of Ngo](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf)_ notes how the CIA aided in establishing a civilian government in South Vietnam. As Diem became more authoritarian and suppressive of minorities, the US tried to persuade him to abide by human rights, however, upon this failing, encouraged but was not involved in, the coup by the military. Ahern traces CIA efforts  to  bring  stability  and  democracy  to  South  Vietnam  and to influence Diem. Although not uncritical of US  policy and CIA operations, Ahern's study reveals a CIA Station-indeed in the early  years, two Stations-working diligently and effectively to aid Diem in forming  a viable  state.
  - _[CIA and the Generals](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf)_  "illustrates Saigon Station efforts to work with and understand the various military  governments  of  South  Vietnam which followed Diem,  and carefully details CIA attempts to stabilize and urge democratization on the changing military regimes."

- In 1954, the US detonated a series of nuclear bombs to study their yield. This was part of Operation Castle. Due to a [miscalculation](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16380885-g1vuWf/16380885.pdf) (p. 205), there was an increase in radiation output than expected. The US Department of Energy estimated that 253 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were impacted by the radioactive fallout. It is alleged that the US deliberately used the Marshallese as "ginea pigs" for testing radiation. This allegation has been throughouly investigated and is not supported by any evidence. [Operation Castle had no biomedical program](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16061854-leUIeE/16061854.pdf). US Military personnel were also exposed to large amounts of radiation, when they thought they were in safe areas of the _expected_ yield.

- In 1945, it has been alleged that Douglas MacArthur pardoned the Japanese unit 731, a unit involved in biological weapons testing.
During the interrogations for war crimes prosecutions, the members gave up information to the US, however, [no evidence](https://networks.h-net.org/node/20904/reviews/21143/fouraker-harris-factories-death-japanese-biological-warfare-1932-1945) indicates that MacArthur pardoned anyone.

- US Firebombings in Germany and Japan, as well as the use of nuclear weapons fell well within international law at the time As one of the world's leading experts [notes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2924907), "President Truman’s classification of the bombing as a purely military objective has caused  some  historians to speculate that the President  engaged in “self-deception.”4  Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate. Although Hiroshima was not a military  base as understood today, it was  a “military city”  as it housed the 2d Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan.5 The city was also a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops...  Nagasaki’s  military  industry  made it significant. The  atomic  bomb  landed between  the two principal targets in the city:  the Mitsubishi Steel and Arm Works and  the  Mitsubishi-Uramaki  Ordnance  Works (Torpedo  Works).
 The atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lawful under the laws of war existing in 1945. These attacks also represent the only two instances  of  atomic  weapon  strikes in  history. They illustrate the definitional confusion existing with respect  to  the  U.S. lassification  of lawful military  objects exclusive of civilian  objects. If some  historians  believe President Truman  was  engaged in “self-deception” in labeling Hiroshima a military target, those historians may be equally perplexed by modern American usage of law-of-war target labels."
